  <p>This page allows the user to ask Cyc&reg; a query.</p>

  <p>To ask a query, enter the query sentence into the "EL
  Sentence" box and press [<i>Start Inference</i>].</p>

  <h3>Query Context</h3>

  <p>The query context is the context in which the query is asked.
  To view the query context settings, click on the "Show" link next
  to "Query Context." By default, the Monad Mt is set to
  #$CurrentWorldDataCollectorMt-NonHomocentric, the time interval
  is set to #$Now, and the time parameter is set to
  #$Null-TimeParameter. To change these settings, simply enter the
  desired value into the appropriate box. (To clear an entry box,
  hit the appropriate "Clear" button. You can type in some of the
  initial letters of the desired value, and then click on
  "Complete" to complete it.) Note that you can change the default
  query context settings on the Options page. To learn more about
  contexts/microtheories in Cyc, see <a href=
  "http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/course/contexts-basic-module.html">Contexts
  in Cyc</a>.</p>

  <h3>Basic Inference Parameters</h3>

  <p>The inference parameters are the settings which specify what
  resources Cyc can use to answer the query. To view the basic
  inference parameters, click on the "Show" link next to "Inference
  Parameters." The Number Cutoff parameter tells Cyc the maximum
  number of answers to return. The Time Cutoff tells Cyc the
  maximum amount of time to spend trying to answer the query. The
  Transformation Cutoff tells Cyc the maximum number of
  transformation steps to use in trying to answer the query.
  Finally, the Probably Done Cutoff tells Cyc when to give up on a
  query on the grounds that it is unlikely to find any (more)
  answers. (You can also see what the parameters mean by hovering
  over their titles with the mouse.) To change any of these
  settings, simply enter the desired value into the box and/or
  select the appropriate radio button.</p>

  <h3>Advanced Inference Parameters</h3>

  <p>The advanced inference parameters are further settings
  specifying how Cyc is to go about trying to answer a query. To
  see these, click on the "Show" link next to "Inference
  Parameters" (if you haven't already); then click on the "Show"
  link next to "Advanced Inference Parameters." As usual, you can
  see what the various parameters mean by hovering over their
  titles with the mouse.</p>

  <h3>Focal Inference</h3>

  <p>The focal inference is the inference for the query most
  recently asked (or designated as the focal inference by the
  user). (Note: the "Focal Inference" section will not show up on
  the query page until you have asked a query.) There are five
  things you can do with the focal inference. You can (1) defocus
  it, (2) destroy it, (3) perform template-based OE on its results,
  (4) save its corresponding query as a query, or (5) save its
  corresponding query as a KB content test. (To learn more about
  what these things mean you can hover over the appropriate
  link.)</p>

  <h3>Other Inferences</h3>

  <p>If you have asked more than one query, the "Other Inferences"
  section will appear near the top of the screen. Clicking on
  [<i>Destroy All</i>] will destroy all inferences but the focal
  inference. To see the non-focal inferences, click on the "Show"
  link next to "Other Inferences." By default, the last ten queries
  are stored in memory. (This setting can be changed on the Options
  page.) You can focus or destroy any individual query by clicking
  on its corresponding [<i>Focus</i>] or [<i>Destroy</i>] link.</p>

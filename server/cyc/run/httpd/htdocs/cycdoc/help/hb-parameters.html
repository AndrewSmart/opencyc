  <h3><a name="settings">Hierarchy Browser Settings</a></h3>

  <p>This page allows you to specify settings for the CYC&reg;
  Hierarchy Browser. Here you can set the starting term (the
  central, focal, or reference term), the microtheory or
  microtheories to be used, the binary predicate to be used, the
  argument position to use as the index, the maximum height and
  depth to display, and various "extra" features.</p>

  <h3><a name="root">Starting Term</a></h3>

  <p>This section of the page allows you to specify the starting
  point, or "pivot" term, around which a hierarchical display will
  be constructed. "Superior" terms will be displayed above and to
  the left of the pivot term. "Inferior" terms will be displayed
  below and to the right of the pivot term. Enter the name of a
  CYC&reg; term (constant, non-atomic term, or lexicon entry) in
  the type-in space. If your input is ambiguous -- that is, if it
  can refer to more than one CYC&reg; term -- you will be presented
  with a menu of terms from which to choose.</p>

  <h3><a name="defaults">Default Settings</a></h3>

  <p>Every CYC&reg; term is a member (element) of one or more sets
  (types, collections). Some types have pre-defined standard, or
  default, display settings (see below). If the term entered in the
  Starting Term type-in space belongs to one of these types, and if
  the checkbox labelled "Use default settings for term" is checked,
  then the default settings for this type of term will be used NO
  MATTER WHAT OTHER SETTINGS ARE SPECIFIED. In other words, if the
  "Use default settings for term" box is checked, and if the
  specified starting term belongs to a type which has default
  settings, then these defaults will override all other settings.
  To turn off the default settings (and thus prevent them from
  overriding other settings you might want specify), simply uncheck
  the "Use default settings for term" box.</p>

  <p>Here are the types which currently have pre-defined default
  settings, and the settings for each type:</p>

  <p>The default settings cannot (easily) be changed by an ordinary
  user. They are somewhat arbitrary, but are designed mainly to
  prevent novice users from unintentionally asking the system to
  construct hierarchical displays that would take several minutes
  of computation time and fill many screenfuls when presented.
  There is nothing to prevent the user from intentionally making
  such requests, by unchecking the "Use default settings for term"
  box!</p>

  <h3><a name="mt">Microtheory</a></h3>

  <p>This section of the page allows you to specify the microtheory
  or microtheories to use when constructing the hierarchical
  display. Note that the CYC&reg; Hierarchy Browser is really just
  another way of looking at a subset of the assertions in the
  CYC&reg; Knowledge Base. Like all CYC&reg; assertions, those
  viewed in the Hierarchy Browser are grouped, or bundled, in
  logical contexts (microtheories). The Hierarchy Browser allows
  you to select assertions from one microtheory, from a set of
  nested microtheories, or from all of the microtheories in the
  CYC&reg; Knowledge Base:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>To view assertions from one microtheory, enter the name of
    the microthoery in the type-in space. If your input is
    ambiguous -- that is, if it can refer to more than one
    microtheory -- you will be presented with a menu of
    microtheories from which to choose.</li>

    <li>If you want to view assertions selected from one
    microtheory and all of its more general (nested) microtheories
    (i.e., those microtheories mapped to by the predicate <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#genlMt">#$genlMt</a>),
    then in addition to entering the name of a microtheory in the
    type-in space, check the box labelled "Use its genl mts too, if
    possible".</li>

    <li>If you want to view assertions selected from all
    microtheories known to CYC&reg;, you have two choices. You can
    enter "ALL" in the type-in space, or you can simply check the
    box labelled "Use all mts".</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that if the box labelled "Use all mts" is checked, this
  will override any other microtheory settings. All microtheories
  will be used, no matter what is entered in the type-in space, and
  regardless of whether or not the other checkbox is checked.</p>

  <p>Note, also, that if the checkbox labelled "Use default
  settings for term" under the heading Starting Term is checked,
  and if the term entered is of a type which has pre-defined
  default settings, then these pre-defined default settings will
  override other microtheory settings, no matter what they are.</p>

  <h3><a name="predicate">Binary Predicate</a></h3>

  <p>This section of the page allows you to specify the binary
  relation that will be used to construct the hierarchical display.
  Enter the name of a binary CYC&reg; predicate in the type-in
  space. If your input is ambiguous -- that is, if it can refer to
  more than one binary predicate -- you will be presented with a
  menu of predicates from which to choose. In most cases, it makes
  sense to specify only a transitive binary predicate, but any
  binary CYC&reg; predicate is allowed.</p>

  <p>Note that if the checkbox labelled "Use default settings for
  term" under the heading Starting Term is checked, and if the term
  entered is of a type which has pre-defined default settings, then
  the pre-defined default predicate will be used no matter what is
  entered in the type-in space for the Binary Predicate
  section.</p>

  <h3><a name="index">Index Argument</a></h3>

  <p>This section of the page allows you to specify which argument
  position the starting or "pivot" term should occupy relative to
  lower or "inferior" terms in CycL expressions using the predicate
  specified in the Binary Predicate section. This information will
  determine whether "broader" terms will appear above and to the
  left of the starting term, or below and to the right of the
  starting term, when the hierarchical display is constructed.</p>

  <p>Suppose I have selected <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a> as my starting
  term, and <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a> as my
  binary predicate. Now I am faced with this choice: do I want the
  terms that are more general than <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a> to appear above
  <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a> in the
  hierarchical display and the terms that are more specific than
  <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a> to
  appear below it, or do I want the terms that are more specific
  than <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a> to
  appear above it and those that are more general to appear below
  it? If I want the more general terms to appear above <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a> and the more
  specific terms to appear below it, I would check the radio button
  marked "2". This means that in gathering and displaying the
  assertions used to construct "inferior" terms, the Hierarchy
  Browswer will start by finding all immediate X such that</p>
  <pre>
  (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a> X <a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a>)
</pre>is true. Then, for each X, X will be substituted for
  <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a> in the
  expression above and the process will (recursively) continue
  until the lower part of the hierarchical display has been
  constructed, or some resource constraint has been reached. Note
  that <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a>
  occupies the 2nd argument position in the CycL expression above.
  To construct the upper part of the hierarchical display (the part
  showing terms "superior" to <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a>), the starting
  CycL expression will be
  <pre>
  (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a> <a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a> X)
</pre>Since the placement of "superior" and "inferior" terms
depends both on the argument position of the starting term, and on
the value ("1" or "2") chosen for the index argument, determining
how to get the hierarchical display to look like you want it to can
sometimes be confusing. If you have chosen one value for the index
argument and the resulting display seems "backwards" to you, simply
select the other index argument value and see if this is what you
want.

  <p>Note that if the checkbox labelled "Use default settings for
  term" under the heading Starting Term is checked, and if the term
  entered is of a type which has pre-defined default settings, then
  the default index argument setting will override the setting
  specifed in the Index Argument section.</p>

  <h3><a name="height">Height and Depth</a></h3>

  <p>This section of the page allows you to specify how many steps
  (ascending) to the left from the starting term, and how many
  steps (descending) to the right from the starting term, should be
  included in the hierarchical display. It also allows you to
  specify a maximum number of "inferior" terms (terms appearing
  below the starting term) to display. The allowed maximum number
  of rightward (descending) levels to display, based on the
  specified maximum number of "inferior" terms, is quickly computed
  before the hierarchical display is constructed. The "Max depth"
  and "Max inferior terms" constraints interact in (possibly)
  unintuitive ways. Here is a specification of the relationship
  between these contraints. Note that (a) overrides (b), which
  overrides (c), which overrides (d):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(a) Only complete levels of inferior terms will be
    displayed. If the max depth setting is NONE, no inferior terms
    will be displayed;</li>

    <li>(b) If the max depth setting is not NONE (i.e., is &gt; 0),
    then at least one complete inferior level will be allowed;</li>

    <li>(c) If a max inferior terms cutoff of N is specified, no
    more than N inferior terms will be displayed;</li>

    <li>(d) If a max depth cutoff of N is specified, no more than N
    inferior levels will be displayed.</li>
  </ul>If the max inferior terms type-in space is left blank, this
  will be interpreted to mean that there is NO UPPER BOUND on the
  number of inferior terms which may be displayed.

  <p>Note that if the checkbox labelled "Use default settings for
  term" under the heading Starting Term is checked, and if the term
  entered is of a type which has pre-defined default settings, then
  the default max height and max depth constraints will be used
  regardless of the settings specified in the Height and Depth
  section. There are no default settings for max inferior terms, so
  this constraint is always honored.</p>

  <h3><a name="extras">Extras</a></h3>

  <p>This section of the page allows you to set additional (mostly
  cosmetic) features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the checkbox labelled "Use lexicon entries, if possible"
    is checked, the hierarchy will be displayed using Cyc's English
    lexicon entries for constants, rather than constant names.
    Constructing the hierarchical display may take longer if this
    option is checked, but the English lexicon entry for a constant
    sometimes gives a better indication of what the constant means
    than does the constant name.</li>

    <li>If the checkbox labelled "Show comments for terms" is
    checked, each term in the hierarchy will be followed by its
    <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment">#$comment</a>
    entry or entries. The <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment">#$comment</a> for a term
    often include a precise description of what the term means. If
    there is more than one <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment">#$comment</a> entry for
    a term, the entries are sorted by microtheory. <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment">#$comment</a> entries
    are not indented like terms in the hierarchical display. They
    are arranged in tabular form by microtheory, starting at the
    left margin of the display.</li>

    <li>If the checkbox labelled "Show assertion's mts after terms"
    is checked, the microtheory (or microtheories) in which the
    relevant assertion occurs is printed after the "inferior" term
    in the assertion. Suppose the predicate <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a> is
    used to construct a hierarchical display of the constant
    <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Fish">#$Fish</a>. A
    fragment of the display might look like this:
      <pre>
  ... AnimalBodyShape
          FishlikeBodyShape [BaseKB]
  ... Heterotroph
          Animal [BiologyMt]
  ... Organism-Whole
          AquaticOrganism [BaseKB, BiologyMt]
          Animal [BaseKB]
              Fish
              [BaseKB -&gt; (Animal, FishlikeBodyShape)]
              [BiologyMt -&gt; (AquaticOrganism)]
                  Barracuda [BaseKB] &lt;-
                  Carp [BaseKB] &lt;-
                  Catfish [BaseKB] &lt;-
</pre>The fragment above is equivalent to the following assertions:
      <pre>
  (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a> <a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FishlikeBodyShape">#$FishlikeBodyShape</a> <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#AnimalBodyShape">#$AnimalBodyShape</a>) in <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB">#$BaseKB</a>

</pre>Note that in the hierarchical display, for all assertions
except those in which the "inferior" term is the starting term, the
microtheory (or occasionally, microtheories) for the assertion is
printed in square brackets following the "inferior" term. A
different convention is used to set off the starting term. It is
printed in a larger font, and in the square brackets following it,
the relevant microtheories are listed with a pointer from each to
the starting term's immediate "superior" terms in that microtheory.
    </li>

    <li>The text input space labelled "Indent quantum" allows you
    to specify how deeply each new level in the hierarchical
    display should be indented. The value must be an integer
    between 0 and 50. Units (quanta) do not correspond to pixels or
    fixed-width font width. Depending on the font used by your
    browser, you may have to experiment to find a pleasing setting.
    3 or 4 seem to produce the best results for a wide variety of
    fonts and font sizes.</li>

    <li>The link labelled "Color and Symbols" will take you to a
    page that allows you to change these settings.</li>

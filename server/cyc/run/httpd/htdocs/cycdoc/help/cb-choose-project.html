  <h3><a name="projects">KE Projects</a></h3>

  <p>Knowledge entry work at Cycorp is often done under a
  particular entry mode, or project, to help detemine where certain
  knowledge falls within the CYC&reg; ontology. However, these
  projects are for Cycorp internal uses only, and releases of the
  CYC&reg; System may or may not use one or more Cyc-Based Project
  as a guideline for determining the content of the release, but
  finished releases will very likely diverge from this guideline,
  in the manner of additions, subtractions, refinements, and
  more.</p>

  <p>The project currently selected is listed after the "Current
  Project" link in the Login Area in the Toolbar frame at the top
  of the screen. The default value is "General Cyc KE", meaning
  that the knowledge entry done will not be attributed to any
  specific project. The projects available for choosing are listed
  on the Choose KE Project page, which can be reached by clicking
  on the "Current Project" link. Clicking on the name of any
  project in this list will take you the KB Browser display for
  that constant, where the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment">#$comment</a> will give an
  explanation of how and when it is to be used.</p>

  <h3><a name="choosing">Choosing a New Project</a></h3>

  <p>To choose a new project, simply select the radio button to the
  left of the desired project. Then press the [<i>Submit</i>]
  button. All operations to the KB will now be marked with the new
  project, until another project is selected.</p>

  <p>To return the radio buttons to their original settings, press
  the [<i>Reset</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a name="data">HL Data</a></h3>

  <p>The Constant Information Display provides a Heuristic Level
  (HL) description of the selected constant. This page will be of
  most use to CYC&reg; System developers; for other users, most of
  the information on this page can be accessed by using the links
  from the Term Index panel in the KB Browser.</p>

  <p>The different display categories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>ID Number:</b> shows the unique constant ID number for
    the given constant.</li>

    <li><b>Name:</b> shows as a string the name of the constant
    being described.</li>

    <li>
      <b>Type List:</b> lists the constant "type", based on the
      following list:

      <ul>
        <li>:predicate</li>

        <li>:collection</li>

        <li>:non-predicate-function</li>

        <li>:attribute</li>

        <li>:microtheory</li>

        <li>:generic (the miscellaneous case)</li>
      </ul>These types are computed from the <a href=
      "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa">#$isa</a>
      assertions about the term in various microtheories and cached
      here for easy access. The canonicalizer uses the constant
      type to determine well-formedness and remove ambiguity.
    </li>

    <li><b>Isa Links:</b> lists <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection">#$Collection</a>s
    of which the constant is an element, organized by <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>.</li>

    <li><b>Genl Links:</b> lists supersets of the given constant,
    organized by <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>.</li>

    <li><b>MDW Links:</b> lists <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection">#$Collection</a>s
    with which the given constant is disjoint (<a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#disjointWith">#$disjointWith</a>).</li>

    <li><b>Spec Links:</b> lists subsets of the given constant,
    organized by <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>.</li>

    <li>
      <b>Index:</b> points to all the indexing involved in going
      from a term to all the assertions about that term. There are
      two types of indexes:

      <ul>
        <li>Simple: a simple list of all assertions about the term.
        This is a compressed, simplified indexing recently added to
        the CYC&reg; System.</li>

        <li>Complex: an index structure which gets printed like:
        <tt>#&lt;INDEX 1234&gt;</tt>. This is an old, full indexing
        that has been in use throughout Cyc-10. Only terms with a
        lot of assertions still use this indexing.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note: Isa, Genl, MDW, and Spec Links are a terse
  representation of the various SBHL hierarchies that an object can
  be in, and are computed from ALL the assertions about the given
  term (not just local ones). Values on the lists of Isa, Genl,
  MDW, and Spec Links are marked as follows: "+" for true links
  based on local assertions; "-" for links that are explicitly
  denied by local assertions; and "|" for links, positive or
  negative, that are inferred rather than asserted locally.
  Redundant assertions are not reflected in these HL
  datastructures.</p>

  <p>A value of NIL for any of the categories means that no values
  were found for that category.</p>

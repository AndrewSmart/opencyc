  <p>The Term Index is used to display information about a selected
  constant in the KB, and is divided into two frames. The left-hand
  frame contains a list of operations that can be performed on the
  displayed constant, as well as an index of assertion types
  involving the constant. The right-hand frame contains the actual
  assertions, and its contents are determined by the term that is
  selected in the left-hand frame index.</p>

  <p>The options available in the Term Index will vary with each
  constant, as well as with different versions of the CYC&reg;
  System. If an option below does not appear do not be alarmed.</p>

  <h3><a name="LHF" id="LHF">Left-Hand Frame</a></h3>

  <p>The constant is displayed at the top of the frame. Clicking on
  the red diamond <img src="/cycdoc/img/cb/red_diam.gif" alt=
  "a red diamond"> will bring up the Hierarchy Browser display for
  the constant. Clicking on the "A" icon <img src=
  "/cycdoc/img/cb/alpha.gif" alt="a capital A on blue background">
  will bring up the Alphabetical Search with the constant as the
  root node.</p>

  <h4><a name="operations" id="operations">Operations on
  Constants</a></h4>

  <p>The various operations that can be performed on the constant
  are listed underneath the constant name:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Filter Mt" is a filtering tool which modifies the Term
    Index to display only those assertions that are in the
    specified <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>.
    The default setting is "All Mts", meaning that filtering is not
    selected and that assertions from all microtheories will be
    displayed. To change microtheories, click on the "Filter Mt"
    link and select the check boxes adjacent to the desired
    microtheories.</li>

    <li>"Create Similar" is a tool which creates a new constant
    similar to the displayed constant, allowing the user to choose
    which of the assertions concerning the displayed constant to
    copy over to the new constant.</li>

    <li>"Rename" is a tool which allows the user to change the name
    of the displayed constant. All assertions concerning the
    displayed constant will be left intact, displayed with the new
    name. Certain constants cannot be renamed directly via the KB
    Browser. For these constants, the "Rename" link will not be
    active. For details, see the <a href=
    "/cycdoc/ref/renames-kills.html">Cyc Rename/Kill
    Documentation</a>.</li>

    <li>"Kill" removes the displayed constant from the KB, and
    deletes all assertions which involve it. A confirmation will be
    requested before the kill is actually executed. Certain
    constants cannot be killed directly via the KB Browser. For
    these constants, the "Kill" link will not be active. For
    details, see the <a href="/cycdoc/ref/renames-kills.html">Cyc
    Rename/Kill Documentation</a>.</li>

    <li>"Force TMS" forces full TMS (Truth-Maintenance) to be
    performed on every assertion involving the given constant.
    Performing TMS on an assertion essentially asks the system to
    reevaluate all of the arguments for that assertion. This is
    most useful when some of the assertions have deduced sources
    which depend on some HL (Heuristic Level) supports which no
    longer hold. Thus, if some assertions on a constant look like
    they have a stale HL support justifying them, clicking on
    "Force TMS" will make the stale arguments go away. Since this
    is a potentially large (and hence time-consuming) computation,
    a confirmation page will appear when this link is
    selected.</li>

    <li>"Diagnose" performs low-level diagnostics on the constant.
    This is only available in certain versions of the CYC&reg;
    System.</li>
  </ul>For certain constants, the hotlinks to "Rename" and "Kill"
  will not be active. These are constants that are mentioned in
  code, and a special procedure must be followed when renaming or
  killing them. See <a href=
  "/cycdoc/ref/renames-kills.html#code">Renaming Constants in Code</a>
  for details. Constants mentioned in code will be labelled "CODE"
  at the top of the right-hand frame when "Definitional Info" is
  selected in the index.

  <p>Constants mentioned in the documentation also have special
  procedures governing their renaming and killing. See <a href=
  "/cycdoc/ref/renames-kills.html#public">Renaming Public Constants</a>
  for details. Constants in the public release will be labelled
  "PUBLIC" at the top of the right-hand frame when "Definitional
  Info" is selected in the index.</p>

  <h4><a name="categories" id="categories">Index
  Categories</a></h4>

  <p>Clicking on an index category in the Term Index will cause the
  corresponding set of assertions involving the displayed constant
  to be displayed in the right-hand frame. For example, clicking on
  "genls" under the "Arg 1" heading will display all of the
  supersets of the constant. Clicking on the red diamond <img src=
  "/cycdoc/img/cb/red_diam.gif"> next to a category will bring up
  the Hierarchy Browser display for the constant using the category
  as the indexing predicate. Clicking on one of the plus "+" icons
  will compute all possible assertions (local plus deduced) in that
  category using the Literal Query tool. Clicking on the category
  itself will display only local assertions of that type.</p>

  <p>The different index categories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Documentation:</b> displays documentation and
    bookkeeping assertions; the most important of these is <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment">#$comment</a>.</li>

    <li><b>Definitional Info:</b> displays basic, definitional
    information, such as <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa">#$isa</a>, <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a>, and
    <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genlPreds">#$genlPreds</a>.</li>

    <li><b>HL Data:</b> displays a Heuristic Level (HL) description
    of the given constant. This option is only available in certain
    versions of the CYC&reg; System.</li>

    <li><b>Lexical Info:</b> displays lexical information,
    including any <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/lexicon-vocab.html#denotation">#$denotation</a>
    links and part-of-speech information.</li>

    <li><b>Applicable Relations:</b> lists those relations which
    can apply to the displayed constant (via some argument).</li>

    <li><b>All Assertions:</b> displays a complete listing of all
    assertions which involve the displayed constant. The total
    number is listed in parentheses.</li>

    <li><b>Public Assertions:</b> displays a listing of assertions
    involving this constant that contain only other public
    constants. A question mark (?) is given for the number of
    assertions because the list of assertions is not computed until
    a request to see them is made. This option is also only
    available in certain versions of the CYC&reg; System. A
    question mark followed by the abbreviation "exp." (? exp.)
    means "potentially expensive"; clicking on links marked thisway
    requests the generation of a large list which may be
    computationally expensive to compile.</li>

    <li><b>IKB Constants:</b> displays a listing of assertions
    involving this constant that contain only constants which are
    elements of #$IKBConstant. A question mark (?) is given for the
    number of assertions because the list of assertions is not
    computed until a request to see them is made. This option is
    also only available in certain versions of the CYC&reg; System.
    A question mark followed by the abbreviation "exp." (? exp.)
    means "potentially expensive"; clicking on links marked thisway
    requests the generation of a large list which may be
    computationally expensive to compile.</li>

    <li><b>All GAFs:</b> displays all ground atomic formulas (GAFs)
    involving the displayed constant. The number to be shown is in
    parentheses; no number means that only one will be shown.</li>

    <li><b>Arg 1-5:</b> displays all assertions in which the
    displayed constant is in the 1st argument position, etc.
    Clicking on a relation sub-header (e.g., <b>isa</b> or
    <b>genls</b>) displays the subset of assertions in which the
    selected relation is used. For example, "genls" under "Arg 1"
    will return rules of the form: (<a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a>
    constant X), i.e. supersets; "genls under "Arg 2" will return
    rules of the form: (<a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a> X
    constant), i.e. subsets. Clicking on a microtheory sub-header
    displays the subset of assertions that are true in the selected
    microtheory.</li>

    <li><b>Predicate Extent:</b> applies only to relations;
    displays all assertions in which the displayed constant is in
    the 0th argument position (e.g., (constant x y)).</li>

    <li><b>All Rules:</b> displays all complex rules (as opposed to
    GAFs) involving the displayed constant.</li>

    <li><b>Antecedent:</b> displays the subset of rules in which
    the displayed constant appears in the antecedent.</li>

    <li><b>Consequent:</b> displays the subset of rules in which
    the displayed constant appears in the consequent.</li>

    <li><b>Microtheory Contents:</b> only available if the
    displayed constant is a <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>;
    displays all assertions in that microtheory.</li>

    <li><b>Miscellaneous:</b> displays all other references to the
    displayed constant that are not covered in the previous
    categories.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="RHF" id="RHF">Right-Hand Frame</a></h3>

  <p>The right-hand frame displays actual assertions in the
  CYC&reg; KB.</p>

  <p>The constant being displayed is listed at the top of the
  frame. When "Definitional Info" is selected in the index, below
  the constant additional information will be listed: the unique
  constant ID number, "PUBLIC" if it's a public constant, "CODE" if
  the constant is mentioned in SubL code.</p>

  <p>Clicking on the colored ball in front of an assertion brings
  up the assertion display page, where various operations can be
  performed on the assertion. See the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/help/browser-icon-key.html" target="documentation-window">Key for
  Icons in the Browser</a> for an explanation of the colored balls
  and other icons.</p>

  <p>Unlike in the index in the left-hand frame, clicking on
  highlighted constant names in the right-hand frame will bring up
  the KB Browser display for that constant.</p>

  <p>Assertions are grouped by the microtheory in which they are
  asserted. Most assertions are written in standard CycL. However,
  "Definitional Info" is listed in an easy-to-read frame-slot
  format like this:</p>
  <pre>
  Arg : 1

  Mt: BaseKB
  isa: Collection
  genls: Individual
</pre>Since the assertions are in the "Arg 1" section, the constant
is in the first argument position for the given relation; under
"Arg 2", the second. Thus the above format represents the
assertions:
  <pre>
  (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa">#$isa</a> constant <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection">#$Collection</a>) in <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB">#$BaseKB</a>
  (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a> constant <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Individual">#$Individual</a>) in <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB">#$BaseKB</a>
  (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls">#$genls</a> <a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Mammal">#$Mammal</a> constant) in <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB">#$BaseKB</a>
</pre>

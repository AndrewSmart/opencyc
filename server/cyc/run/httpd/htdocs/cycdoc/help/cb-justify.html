  <h3><a>Justification vs. Arguments</a></h3>

  <p>The Justify tool is very similar to the Arguments tool in that
  it displays the arguments that support the displayed assertion.
  However, the Arguments tool only displays those arguments which
  immediately support the displayed assertion, while Justify
  provides the entire chain of arguments which together imply the
  displayed assertion. The Justify tool starts with the displayed
  assertion, finds its immediate arguments, finds the arguments'
  arguments, and so on until it reaches only local assertions
  (assertions whose source is outside of CYC&reg;, e.g., something
  directly asserted by a human CYC&reg; user).</p>

  <p>For information about the Arguments tool, see the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/help/cb-arguments.html">Arguments Help"</a> page.</p>

  <h3><a name="justify">Assertion Justifications</a></h3>

  <p>This page first displays the assertion supported, followed by
  its justification. The justification is listed from most
  immediate argument to least immediate, indenting each time it
  goes back another level. A typical justification might be
  structured as follows:</p>
  <pre>
Argument : Deduced #11997313

    [Main-Argument-1]
    [Main-Argument-2]
        Argument : Deduced #3565200
            [Sub-Argument-A]
            [Sub-Argument-B]
</pre>Here, [Sub-Argument-A] and [Sub-Argument-B] are assertions
which support [Main-Argument-2]. Since [Main-Argument-1],
[Sub-Argument-A], and [Sub-Argument-B] are all leaf nodes of the
justification tree (no arguments are listed for them), they must be
local assertions.

  <p>Clicking on any of the "Deduced" links will display in more
  detail the argument source for the assertion it follows. So in
  the example above, clicking on "Deduced #3565200" will display
  the argument source for [Main-Argument-2], while "Deduced
  #11997313" is a link to the argument source for the main
  assertion.</p>

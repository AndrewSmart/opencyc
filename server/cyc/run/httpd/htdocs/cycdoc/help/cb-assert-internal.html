  <p>This page offers help for four different tools that are
  essentially the same to use:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Assert Formula</li>

    <li>Assert Similar Formula</li>

    <li>Edit Assertion</li>

    <li>Fix Typo</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="tools">Assert, Assert Similar, Edit</a></h3>

  <p>All three tools have the exact same interface, and all result
  in a formula being asserted to the KB. However, there are a few
  key differences in how they operate:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Assert Formula allows the user to enter a completely new
    formula. As such, there are no defaults for the input fields,
    except for Strength, which is set to Default.</li>

    <li>Edit Assertion allows the user to edit an assertion already
    existing in the KB. Assertions edited using the Edit Assertion
    tool will be deleted from the KB, and the new version will be
    asserted in its place. The various parts of the original
    assertion are used as defaults for the input fields, including
    the formula, microtheory, strength, and direction.</li>

    <li>Assert Similar Formula allows the user to add a new formula
    similar to one already existing in the KB. Assertions edited
    using the Assert Similar Formula will NOT be deleted from the
    KB. Instead, the old assertion will remain in the KB, and the
    new version will be asserted as well. As with the Edit
    Assertion tool, the various parts of the original assertion are
    used as defaults for the input fields.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Fix Typo</h3>

  <p>The Fix Typo tool is similar to the Edit Assertion tool, but
  its use is more restricted. The edited sentence can only differ
  from the original sentence in a string argument (e.g. the second
  argument of a #$comment assertion). Also, it is not possible to
  change the strength, direction, or microtheory of an assertion
  using this tool. Note that the Fix Typo tool preserves the
  bookkeeping information on the original assertion.</p>

  <h3><a name="changes">Adding and Editing</a></h3>

  <p>To add a new assertion, simply enter the relevant information
  into each of the input fields provided, then press the
  [<i>Perform Edit</i>] button. Leaving the Direction field
  unchecked will cause the default values for that type of
  assertion to be used (GAFs: forward, rules: backward).</p>

  <p>To edit an assertion, simply change the information provided,
  either by editing the text or by clicking the appropriate button.
  To assert the formula, press the [<i>Perform Edit</i>]
  button.</p>

  <p>To delete an assertion, go to the Assertion Display Frame for
  the selected assertion and click on "Unassert" (local assertions)
  or "Blast" (deduced assertions). See the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/help/cb-af.html">help page for the Assertion Display Frame</a> for
  details on deleting or blasting assertions.</p>

  <p>To restore input fields to their values before editing, press
  the [<i>Reset</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To abort the edit completely and return to the previous page,
  press the [<i>Abort Edit</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a name="fields">The Input Fields</a></h3>

  <p>The interface for the three tools contains a number of input
  fields:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Mt: enter the microtheory (minus the "#$") in which the
    formula is to be asserted. To take advantage of constant
    completion, enter a partial microtheory name and press the
    [<i>Complete</i>] button. Remember that a list of completions
    will appear in a separate HTML browser window if the completion
    is not unique.</li>

    <li>EL Sentence: enter the sentence, using CycL syntax (which
    utilizes the "#$"). To take advantage of constant completion,
    type the first part of a CYC&reg; constant in the input window,
    then press the [<i>Complete</i>] button.</li>

    <li>Strength: choose either Default or Monotonic, choosing both
    is not possible. False assertions (which it is rare to enter)
    can be made using <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not">#$not</a>.</li>

    <li>Direction: choose either Backward or Forward, choosing both
    is not possible. If no value is selected (only an option for
    new assertions), the default values for that type of assertion
    will be used (GAFs: forward, rules: backward).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The interface for the Fix Typo tool only contains an input
  field for EL sentence.</p>

  <p>For more information on CycL syntax, assertions,
  microtheories, strengths, and directions, see <a href=
  "/cycdoc/ref/cycl-syntax.html">The Syntax of CycL</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="email">Email Notifications for Edit Assertion and
  Fix Typo</a></h3>

  <p>While editing an assertion or fixing a typo in an assertion,
  it is possible to send out a notification to the owner of the
  assertion (and possibly others) by checking the the small box to
  the left of ``email notify'' and entering the usernames of the
  Cyclists to receive the notification in the text input area that
  is immediately to the right. Note that if the assertion owner is
  a current Cycorp employee, then their username will automatically
  appear in the text input box; you can enter additional usernames
  by separating them with spaces or commas. It is also possible to
  enter an (optional) explanation on why the modification in
  question was necessary; any such explanation will be appended to
  the default email message body sent out by Cyc.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that email notifications are sent out
  during assertion editing. In other words, Cyc doesn't wait to see
  if the cyclist will actually transmit the modification and send
  out the email only then.</p>

  <p>This page shows the state of the CYC&reg; Agenda, and allows
  the user to control the Agenda Process by starting and halting
  it, and by selecting an error handling mode.</p>

  <h3><a name="states">Agenda States</a></h3>For all practical
  purposes, the CYC&reg; Agenda has two states: Halted or Running.
  The Agenda Status Bar may list several other states, including
  Enabled or Idle, but since those states play no significant role
  in the Agenda Process Control, they are grouped together on this
  page under "Running", primarily as a matter of convenience. See
  the <a href="/cycdoc/help/cb-server-status.html">Agenda Status Bar Help</a>
  for details on the different Agenda states.

  <ul>
    <li>Halted: The Agenda can be halted due to an error, because
    it was halted manually, or because it was never initially
    started after the CYC&reg; image was started up. If the Agenda
    is "halted" due to an error, "Agenda halted due to" will show
    the reason why the Agenda has halted. If it was halted
    manually, "Current Agenda operation" will show the operation
    that the Agenda has most recently processed. If the Agenda has
    not yet processed any operations, this part of the page will be
    blank. When the Agenda is halted, it will not process any
    operations.</li>

    <li>Running: When the Agenda is running, it is either
    processing operations, or waiting for operations to process.
    "Current Agenda operation" will show the operation that the
    Agenda is currently processing or has most recently
    processed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="start">Starting and Halting the Agenda</a></h3>

  <p>In the middle of this page is a button that controls whether
  the CYC&reg; Agenda is running or halted. Depending on whether
  the Agenda is currently running, it will be labelled either
  "Start Agenda" or "Halt Agenda".</p>

  <p>To start the Agenda up again after it has been halted, click
  on the [<i>Start Agenda</i>] button. Operations cannot be
  processed unless the Agenda is running, so it's a good idea to
  keep the Agenda running whenever possible.</p>

  <p>To halt the Agenda, click on the [<i>Halt Agenda</i>] button.
  Remember to restart it when you want to continue processing
  operations.</p>

  <h3><a name="errors">Error Handling Modes</a></h3>

  <p>The Agenda Process can also be controlled by setting the error
  handling mode, which tells the Agenda what to do when it
  encounters an error while processing operations.</p>

  <p>There are three possible modes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Enter Debugger:</b> Errors appear in the emacs window
    where the CYC&reg; image was started; in that window, the
    CYC&reg; process will be in the debugger, and the user will be
    given a range of options to choose from (the two most commonly
    used are "continue" and "abort"). The HTML interface may partly
    freeze when there is an error; choosing an option in the
    debugger should return things to normal. This mode is only
    available in CYC&reg; versions with access to the <a href=
    "/cycdoc/ref/glossary.html#SubL">SubL</a> source code, and is
    usually the default mode in a new CYC&reg; image for those
    versions.</li>

    <li><b>Halt and Display Reason:</b> Errors appear on the Agenda
    Process Control page, and the Agenda will halt, which will be
    reflected by the Agenda status being listed as "None" in the
    Agenda Status Bar. Click on the [<i>Start Agenda</i>] button to
    abort the error and restart the Agenda. For versions of
    CYC&reg; without access to the SubL source code, this mode will
    usually be the default mode in a new CYC&reg; image, unless
    your System Administrator has installed CYC&reg; with different
    defaults.</li>

    <li><b>Ignore and Continue:</b> Errors will be bypassed and the
    Agenda will continue running; no notice or record of the error
    will be produced. This mode should be used with caution, since
    a user will have no way of knowing if their work has caused an
    error.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="set-error">Setting the Error Handling Mode:</a></h3>

  <p>Click on one of the buttons to the left of the three modes,
  then press the [<i>Submit New Mode</i>] button. A message will
  appear confirming the new communication mode. To reset the
  buttons to reflect the current error handling mode, press the
  [Current Mode] button.</p>

  <p>Note that the current error handling mode is always listed at
  the top of this section.</p>

  <h3><a name="local-queue">The Local Queue</a></h3>

  <p>If there are unprocessed operations in the local queue, one
  final section will appear in the Agenda Process Control. This
  section will list how many operations are waiting in the local
  queue, as well as provide the following options:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Look at the operations in the local queue" displays the
    (unprocessed) contents of the local queue, in order, and allows
    the user to clear the entire queue, if desired.</li>

    <li>"Delete the local queue" goes straight to clearing the
    queue without displaying the contents. A confirmation page is
    provided in case the user decides not to delete the entire
    queue after all.</li>
  </ul>

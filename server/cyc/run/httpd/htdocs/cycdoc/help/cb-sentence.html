  <h3>Viewing a CycL Sentence</h3>

  <p>This page displays a CycL sentence. This sentence might or
  might not correspond with any assertion in the KB. It might be
  true, false, or unknown.</p>

  <h3><a name="details">CycL Sentence Details</a></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>"Mt" lists the <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>
    of this sentence, if it is a contextualized sentence. A
    contextualized sentence is a sentence of the form (#$ist MT
    PROP).</li>

    <li>"HL Formula" lists the actual sentence being viewed, in HL
    form.</li>

    <li>"EL Formula" lists the sentence in its EL form, if the HL
    form differs from the EL form. Many CycL sentences have
    identical HL and EL forms.</li>

    <li>"English Translation" provides an English version of the
    assertion, generated by CYC&reg;.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="operations">Operations on CycL Sentences</a></h3>

  <p>There are a number of different operations involving CycL
  sentences, many of which are similar to <a href=
  "/cycdoc/help/cb-af.html#operations">operations on assertions</a>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Diagnose" performs well-formedness (wff) checking on the
    CycL sentence.</li>

    <li>"Assert Similar" brings up an editing window with the CycL
    sentence as a default. The user can then modify the new copy
    (or not) before asserting it into the KB.</li>

    <li>"Ask Similar" brings up an editing window with the CycL
    sentence as a default. The user can then modify the new copy
    (or not) before asking it.</li>
  </ul>For more information about CycL sentences, read the <a href=

  <p>Certain constants are included in a Cyc Knowledge Base simply
  to support or enable one or more Cyc-based applications or
  capabilities. These constants are not used to represent common
  sense knowledge; nor are they used to represent knowledge shared
  by a significant subset of humans, such as specialized domain
  knowledge (e.g. the knowledge of experts in some field of study,
  such as nuclear physics). Any constant that meets this
  description should be made an instance either of
  #$ImplementationConstant or of one of its specializations. This
  will help Cyc to distinguish its common sense knowledge from its
  application-specific knowledge.</p>

  <p>For example, suppose you create a Cyc-based application (an
  application which relies on the Cyc API) called MailManager, and
  you want the program to maintain within the Cyc KB a reified list
  of e-mail addresses, called #$MailManagerAddresses. To indicate
  the application-specific nature of MailManager constants, you
  could first create the new constant
  #$MailManagerApplicationConstant as an instance of
  #$ApplicationConstant. (#$ApplicationConstant is a specialization
  of #$ImplementationConstant.) Then, you could assert (#$isa
  #$MailManagerAddresses #$MailManagerApplicationConstant).</p>

  <p>After asserting that TERM is an instance either of
  #$ImplementationConstant or of one of its specializations, the
  following sentence will appear just below the term's name in the
  Term Content frame of the KB Browser:</p>

  <p><font style="color:red"><b><u>TERM</u> is not used to
  represent common sense knowledge.</b></font></p>

  <p>This page shows currently active filters and allows the user
  to make changes to the current filtering state.</p>

  <h3><a name="saving">Saving and Loading Filter
  Settings</a></h3>Filter settings can be saved out to a file.
  There is a unique file for each Cyclist, so saving user settings
  will overwrite previous saved settings for that Cyclist.

  <p>Once saved, filter settings can be loaded back in from a file.
  The file loaded will be the unique file of settings for the
  cyclist logged in.</p>

  <h3><a name="types">Methods of Filtering
  Operations</a></h3>Remote operations can be filtered by
  specifying any of three objects, as follows.

  <ul>
    <li><b>Filter Terms:</b> Specifying a term to use will cause
    all remote operations which contain that term to be ignored by
    the CYC&reg; Agenda. That means that those operations will not
    be loaded into the CYC&reg; image and will not be accessible
    thereafter. Note NATs are not explored recursively to find all
    atomic terms which make them up. This means that a CYC&reg;
    formula will not be filtered for containing a NAT which
    contains a filtered term.</li>

    <li><b>Filter Collections:</b> Specifying a collection to use
    will cause all remote operations which contain any spec of that
    collection to be ignore by the CYC&reg; Agenda exactly as if
    that spec had itself been listed as a term to be filtered.</li>

    <li><b>Transcript Filters:</b> Specifying a transcript filter
    to use will cause all terms associated with the transcript
    filter via the #$filterTerms predicate to be filtered exactly
    as if they had been specified separately as above. Similarly
    all collections associated with the transcript filter via the
    #$filterCollections predicate will be filtered as filter
    collections above.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="editing">Adding and Removing Filter
  Settings</a></h3>Filter settings can be added to any of the three
  categories available by simply typing in the name of the term,
  collection, or transcript filter in the appropriate box and
  clicking on the "Update Filters" button at the top of the page.
  Clicking "Reset Values" will clear all boxes of whatever text has
  been typed in them.

  <p>To remove filter settings simply uncheck the checkbox beside
  the CYC&reg; constant that you do not want filtered and then
  click the "Update Filters" button. Clicking "Remove All Filters"
  will remove all the active transcript filters, collections and
  terms. This is equivalent to unchecking them all and then
  clicking "Update Filters".</p>

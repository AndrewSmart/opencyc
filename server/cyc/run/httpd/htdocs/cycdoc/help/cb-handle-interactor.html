  <p>The SubL Interactor is an input window for evaluating SubL
  expressions.</p>

  <h3><a name="eval">Evaluating Expressions</a></h3>

  <p>To evaluate an expression, simply enter the expression in the
  window and press the [<i>Eval</i>] button. This will bring up a
  new frame which contains the last form (the expression just
  evaluated), the results of the evaluation, and a fresh input
  window. If the expression is malformed an error message is
  returned.</p>

  <p>To get constant completion while typing in an expression,
  press the [<i>Complete</i>] button in the middle of a constant
  name. As always, possible completions (if there is more than one)
  will be displayed in a separate completion window which will be
  reused for future completions. Completion is case sensitive, and
  requires that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.</p>

  <p>To completely refresh the input window and start over, press
  the [<i>Clear</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To return to the previous frame, press the [<i>Back</i>]
  button.</p>

  <h3><a name="documentation">Function Documentation</a></h3>

  <p>To view the documentation and arglist for any SubL function,
  click on "Show function documentation", type in an incomplete
  function expression, and click on the [<i>Eval</i>] button.
  Instead of trying to evaluate the expression, the Interactor will
  find the first incomplete function call it can and return the
  arglist along with any explicit documentation. For example,</p>
  <pre>
        (ke-assert
</pre>entered into the input window (with "show function
documentation" on) will return:
  <pre>
        KE-ASSERT : (FORMULA MT &amp;OPTIONAL STRENGTH DIRECTION)
        [documentation would go here if there were any]
</pre>Note that this feature is not available in all versions of
the CYC&reg; System.

  <p>At certain times (such as when function documentation is
  shown), the form originally entered is returned in the input
  window; if new text is then entered into the window, pressing the
  [<i>Reset</i>] button will replace the newly entered text with
  the original returned text. This option is only available if text
  has been returned in the window by the Interactor.</p>

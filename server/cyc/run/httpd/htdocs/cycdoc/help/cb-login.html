  <p>This page allows CYC&reg; users to login to their CYC&reg;
  image, as well as lists what users are currently logged in to the
  image.</p>

  <p>When a new CYC&reg; image is started, the user is initially
  logged in with the default login constant for that copy of
  CYC&reg;, such as #$HPKB-User or #$CYC-User. If no such default
  exists, the user will initially be logged in as #$Guest. Guests
  are allowed to browse the CYC&reg; KB, but not to perform any
  operations on it, such as editing an assertion, creating new
  constants, halting the image, etc. In order to gain full access,
  it is necessary to login to the CYC&reg; image using your
  CYC&reg; constant. Users logged in with a default login constant
  (not #$Guest) do have full access, but it's still a good idea to
  login with your own CYC&reg; constant.</p>

  <h3><a name="login">Logging In</a></h3>

  <p>To access the Login Area, click on the Login link in the
  Toolbar frame at the top of the screen. The first line of the
  login page shows what your current login is. If you have just
  started up the image, this will either say "Guest" or the name of
  the default login constant; likewise if this is the first time
  you are accessing from your machine an image that someone else
  has started up elsewhere.</p>

  <p>To change identities (including from or to #$Guest), enter the
  name of your CYC&reg; constant in the type-in pane provided
  (minus the "#$"), then press the (<i>Submit</i>) button. For
  example, the user Fred Smith might be represented in the KB as
  #$FredSmith. To login, Fred would type "FredSmith" in the input
  window.</p>

  <p>If you do not currently have a CYC&reg; constant, you can
  create one as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>People logged in as #$Guest cannot create new constants,
    and so should find someone who does have a CYC&reg; constant
    and have them login. Users logged in with the default login
    constant can skip this step.</li>

    <li>Type into the window the name you'd like for your CYC&reg;
    constant (remembering that constant names for <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Individual">#$Individual</a>s
    such as people should start with a capital letter); CYC&reg;
    will respond with the message "Unknown Cyclist" and ask if you
    want to create a new CYC&reg; constant with that name. Click on
    "Yes" to confirm and create the constant, "No" to return to the
    Login Area without creating it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Note:</b> Creating a new user constant is the same as
  performing any other operation on the CYC&reg; KB: the change is
  only to the local image unless it's transmitted at some point. If
  you want your constant to become part of CYC&reg; (if you're
  using a distributed AI architecture, like at Cycorp), be sure
  that you are in a mode that will allow transmission of operations
  to the master transcript. The recommended way to do this is to
  set the communication mode to Storing and Receiving, create your
  constant, go to the Communication page and select "Send stored
  operations now", and click on the "Submit" button. Alternately,
  you can set the communication mode to Sending and Receiving from
  the beginnning. If for some reason you create your constant and
  then restart your image prior to the next dump, you won't be able
  to log in using your new constant until your machine has received
  the creation operation from the master transcript. Remember that
  you'll have to switch to a receiving mode to get any operations.
  Do not create yourself a second time, as this will cause an
  error. For details on transcripts, communication modes, and
  dumps, see <a href="/cycdoc/ref/system.html">The CYC&reg; Agenda and
  CYC&reg; Transcripts</a>. For help changing communication modes,
  click on the "Mode" link in the Agenda Status Bar and see the
  <a href="/cycdoc/help/cb-mode.html">New Mode Area Help</a> available
  there.</p>

  <h3><a name="projects">Selecting a Project</a></h3>

  <p>Certain versions of CYC&reg; will allow the user to select a
  project heading under which KE work should be logged. If this
  feature is available, the link "Current Project" will appear
  below the user login section, with the currently selected project
  listed to the right of the link. The default value is "General
  Cyc KE". To select a new project heading, simply click on the
  "Current Project" link to go to the Choose KE Project page, then
  select a project from the list shown. To see a full desciption in
  the CYC&reg; KB of the current project (when other than "none"),
  click on the project name itself.</p>

  <h3><a name="users">Sharing a CYC&reg; Image</a></h3>

  <p>At the bottom of the page is a list of users who are logged
  into the current image. Both their username and machine are
  listed. This is important because two users on the same image
  will share transcripts, communication modes, etc, and so it is
  necessary to coordinate knowledge entry between users of a shared
  image. (Simply browsing on a shared image presents no
  complications, however.)</p>

  <p>This facility allows the user to search through an
  alphabetical list of constants.</p>

  <h3><a name="search">Searching the Index</a></h3>

  <p>The search usually starts with a root node. There are two main
  ways of selecting this node:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A string was entered into the Toolbar input window that
    CYC&reg; was unable to match with a constant in the KB. In this
    case the Alphabetical Search is brought up with the phrase
    "[string] would be here" inserted where [string] would fall in
    the Alphabetical index were [string] to be a constant name.
    [string] is then the root node.</li>

    <li>The "A" icon <img src="/cycdoc/img/cb/alpha.gif" alt=
    "a capital A on blue background"> next to a constant name is
    clicked. In this case the Alphabetical Search is brought up
    with the selected constant as the root node.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Constant names beginning with lowercase letters are listed
  after uppercase ones. Thus "Z" comes before "a".</p>

  <p>Click on the "Page Up" link to see the set of constant names
  immediately previous in the alphabet to the displayed set.</p>

  <p>Click on the "Page Down" link to see the set of constant names
  immediately following in the alphabet to the displayed set.</p>

  <p>"Top" takes you to the beginning of the alphabetical
  listing.</p>

  <p>"Bottom" takes you to the end of the alphabetical listing.</p>

  <p>Use the list of uppercase and lowercase letters to jump to
  that part of the alphabet.</p>

  <p>As usual, click on a constant name to see that constant
  displayed in the KB Browser.</p>

  <p>Click on the red diamond <img src=
  "/cycdoc/img/cb/red_diam.gif"> to view that constant using the
  Hierarchy Browser.</p>

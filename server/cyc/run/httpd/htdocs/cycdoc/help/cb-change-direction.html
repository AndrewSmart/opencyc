  <p>To change the assertion direction of the displayed assertion,
  select a new direction (Forward or Backward), then press the
  [<i>Change Direction</i>] button. The assertion itself is
  displayed in its EL form at the bottom of the page.</p>

  <p>This will delete the assertion from the KB, and reassert it
  with the new direction. This is better than using the Assert
  Similar Formula facility, since it is usually undesirable to have
  the same formula asserted with two different directions at the
  same time.</p>

  <p>There is a third direction, Code, for assertions for which
  special HL modules have been written to supplant the need for
  inference using the assertion itself. These assertions are left
  in the KB for pedagogical and documentation reasons, but are not
  actually used in inference (outside of the HL modules). Code
  assertions cannot be edited via the HTML interface, and the
  ability to make Code assertions is only possible in versions of
  CYC&reg; with access to the SubL source code.</p>

  <p>To restore the setting for assertion direction to its value
  before editing, press the [<i>Current Value</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To abort the edit completely and return to the previous page,
  press the [<i>Abort Edit</i>] button.</p>

  see <a href="/cycdoc/ref/cycl-syntax.html#assertions">The Syntax of
  CycL</a>.</p>

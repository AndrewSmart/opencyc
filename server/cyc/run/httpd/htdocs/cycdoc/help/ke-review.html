  <p>This page allows you to set up appropritae filters for review
  of constants and assertions that have been created. It's meant to
  make reviewing KE easier!</p>

  <p>By turning on tags and links, relevant unreviewed constants
  and/or assertions will get a little tag which links to a review
  page. These pages allow the reviewer to assert that they approve
  of the constant or assertion as well as to attach additional
  comments to the constant or assertion.</p>

  <p>Filters for these specific adornments can also be used,
  including the start and end date, and the particular cyclists who
  must be the #$myCreator for the assertion and or constant.</p>

  <p>To restore the settings to the state they held when entering
  this page, press the [ <i>Current Values</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To abort the edit completely and return to the previous page,
  press the [<i>Back</i>] or [<i>Cancel</i>] buttons.</p>

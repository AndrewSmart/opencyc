  <p>The Browser History provides a list of constants, NATs
  (non-atomic terms), assertions, and sentences that have been
  recently accessed by the current user in the current CYC&reg;
  image.</p>

  <p>Clicking on the "Clear History" link will remove all CycL
  terms that are currently in the KB Browser History, returning the
  Browser History to its initial state.</p>

  <p>By default, formulas in the KB Browser History are displayed
  in HL format. To view them in EL format, click on the "EL
  Formulas" link. One can use this link to toggle back and forth
  between the HL and EL display modes.</p>

  <p>The KB Browser History is divided into four sections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Recent Constants": lists the CYC&reg; constants most
    recently viewed in this CYC&reg; image.</li>

    <li>"Recent NATs": lists the CYC&reg; NATs most recently viewed
    in this CYC&reg; image.</li>

    <li>"Recent Assertions": lists the CYC&reg; assertions most
    recently viewed in this CYC&reg; image.</li>

    <li>"Recent Sentences": lists the CYC&reg; sentences (that are
    not assertions) most recently viewed in this CYC&reg;
    image.</li>
  </ul>Clicking on the "Clear Constant History" link will remove
  all CycL constants that are currently in the KB Browser History,
  returning that part of the Browser History to its initial state
  (and similarly for "Clear NAT History," "Clear Assertion
  History," and "Clear Sentence History").

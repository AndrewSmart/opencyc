  <p>The <a href="/cycdoc/ref/system.html#com-modes">communication
  status</a> of a CYC&reg; image determines how operations will be
  transmitted, received, and recorded by the CYC&reg; Agenda. This
  page allows the user to change the communication status of the
  current CYC&reg; image.</p>

  <h3><a name="modes">Communication Status</a></h3>There are two
  sections that determine your communication status:

  <ol>
    <li>The first section controls what happens to operations which
    you produce. If you do not have any operations stored in your
    local transcript you will see the following options:

      <ul>
        <li><i>Send Immediately:</i> Transmit all local operations
        to the transcript server as they are processed (or write
        them to the master transcript file if this CYC&reg; image
        is not set up to use a transcript server).</li>

        <li><i>Store For Later:</i> Write local operations to a
        local transcript file. You may transmit them latter.</li>

        <li><i>Do Not Record:</i> Do not make a record of the
        operations after they have been processed.</li>
      </ul>If you do have operations stored, you must handle them
      first before you can change out of storing mode. You will see
      the following options:

      <ul>
        <li><i>Send Stored Operations:</i> Transmit all stored
        operations to the transcript server (or write them to the
        master transcript file if this CYC&reg; image is not set up
        to use a transcript server). This also renames the local
        transcript by adding "-sent" into the name and starts a new
        local transcript file.</li>

        <li><i>Clear Stored Operations:</i> Throws away all stored
        operations. This also renames the local transcript by
        adding "-cleared" into the name and starts a new local
        transcript file.</li>
      </ul><b>Note:</b> If your local queue is non-empty (meaning
      there are still operations you have produced that have not
      been processed by the agenda), you will be unable to change
      the transmission part of your communication status, and will
      not see either of these options. You will see a warning
      instead.
    </li>

    <li>The second section controls whether you will receive
    operations transmitted by other CYC&reg; images. You will have
    the following options:

      <ul>
        <li><i>Yes:</i> receive operations that others have
        transmitted.</li>

        <li><i>No:</i> do not receive operations from others.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="settings">Setting the Communication Status</a></h3>

  <p>To change the communication settings, select the desired
  setting in each section and click on the [<i>Submit</i>] button.
  The [<i>Current Value</i>] button will restore the previous
  values for the entire page.</p>

  <p>Communication statuses are described in detail in the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/ref/system.html#com-modes">CYC&reg; Communication Status
  Documentation</a>.</p>

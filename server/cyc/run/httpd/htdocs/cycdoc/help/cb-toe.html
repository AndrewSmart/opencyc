  <p>The Template-Based OE tool (or "TOE") harnesses the Cyc&reg;
  inference engine to enable users to do batch KE operations. By
  formulating a query in the syntax of CycL (see <a href=
  "/cycdoc/ref/cycl-syntax.html">The Syntax of CycL</a>) on the TOE, a
  user can produce a list of CycL terms that can be passed through
  an OE template, thereby generating a batch of "kill", "assert",
  "unassert", or "blast" operations.</p>

  <h3><a name="specifying">Specifying a Query</a></h3>

  <p>To use the TOE, the user first formulates a query on the
  "Query Specification" page of the TOE. The bindings returned by
  this query can be passed through one of the OE templates that are
  available from the TOE.</p>

  <p>The "Query Specification" page of the TOE works in a manner
  that is very similar to the way the Ask tool works (see the
  <a href="/cycdoc/help/cb-handle-ask.html">Ask a Query</a> help page) -- the
  TOE query specification is formulated in exactly the same way a
  Ask tool query specification is formulated, and a TOE query
  specification is handed to the Cyc inference engine with query
  parameters set to 0 backchains, a number cutoff of "get
  everything", a time cutoff of "run forever", and a depth cutoff
  of "infinite depth".</p>

  <p>To formulate a query specification for the TOE, the user
  enters the microtheory in which the query is to run in the "Mt:"
  window. It doesn't matter whether the Mt name is typed with or
  without "#$" before it. The CycL query to be run is entered into
  the "Formula" input window. In this window, constant names
  require their "#$" prefixes. The [<i>Cyclify</i>] button adds
  "#$" before each valid constant name in the window. Pressing the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button next to either the Mt or Formula window
  finishes a partially typed constant name in the respective
  window. (In the Formula window, Complete works only on the last
  term in the window.) If the typed string has multiple
  completions, Complete displays a list of possible choices in a
  separate Completions window.</p>

  <p>Once the user has formulated a query and entered the name of
  the microtheory in which the query is to be asked, there are 5
  options: the user can press [<i>Run Query</i>], or the user can
  choose from among the "Available Templates:" buttons, which are
  [<i>Assert</i>], [<i>Unassert</i>], [<i>Blast</i>],
  [<i>Kill</i>].</p>

  <h3>Running a Query</h3>Clicking on the [<i>Run Query</i>] button
  queries Cyc about the formula in the microtheory specified, and
  returns the results as a list of bindings that are printed to the
  interface. Using the [<i>Run Query</i>] button is a good way for
  the user to test the query that has been entered to see if it
  returns the results the user expects. For example, if the user
  asks for all the specializations of #$Dog that are known in the
  #$BaseKB by entering "#$BaseKB" in the "Mt:" window and "(#$genls
  ?X #$Dog)" in the "Query Specification:" window and pressing the
  [<i>Run Query</i>] button, the user will be taken to a new page
  that looks like this:
  <pre>

       Query Results

       3 Answers     ?X

       [Explain #1]  Dog
       [Explain #2]  (FemaleFn Dog)
       [Explain #3]  (JuvenileFn Dog)

       [Examine the inference tree]
       
</pre>If these are the bindings the user expects, then the user
should return to the "Query Specification" page of the TOE in order
to to use one of the available templates.

  <h3>Available Templates</h3>Once the user has formulated a query
  and entered the name of the microtheory in which the query is to
  be asked, the user may generate a batch KE operation by selecting
  from among 4 of the "Available Templates:" buttons, which are
  [<i>Kill</i>], [<i>Assert</i>], [<i>Unassert</i>], and
  [<i>Blast</i>].

  <h3>The [<i>Kill</i>] Template</h3>Clicking on the [<i>Kill</i>]
  button on the "Query Specification" page queries Cyc about the
  formula in the microtheory specified, and enters each binding as
  a replacement for X in an OE template of the form: (KE-KILL X).
  The resultant operations are printed to the interface and the
  user can select from among them which ones are to be processed.
  Thus, if the user asks for all the specializations of #$Dog that
  are known in the #$BaseKB by entering "#$BaseKB" in the "Mt:"
  window and "(#$genls ?X #$Dog)" in the "Query Specification:"
  window and pressing the [<i>Kill</i>] button, the user will be
  taken to a new page that looks like this:
  <pre>

   Resulting Forms

   Current query in BaseKB :
   (genls ?X Dog)
   
   [Add Forms to Agenda]
    
   Operations:                              OK?
   (KE-KILL (JuvenileFn Dog))               [x]
   (KE-KILL (FemaleFn Dog))                 [x]
   (KE-KILL Dog)                            [x] 

</pre>The user can add all of the selected operations to the agenda
by pressing [<i>Add Forms to Agenda</i>]. An operation counts as
"selected" if the box in its row under "OK?" is clicked. By
default, all of the operations are selected.

  <h3>The [<i>Assert</i>] Template</h3>Clicking on the
  [<i>Assert</i>] button on the "Query Specification" page stores
  the query and takes the user to a template-building "Assert
  Specification" page. To formulate an assert specification for the
  TOE, the user enters the microtheory in which the assertion is to
  be made in the "Mt:" window. As on the "Query Specification"
  page, it doesn't matter whether the Mt name is typed with or
  without "#$" before it. The assertion template is entered into
  the "EL Formula" input window. In this window, constant names
  require their "#$" prefixes. The [<i>Cyclify</i>] button adds
  "#$" before each valid constant name in the window. Pressing the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button next to either the Mt or Formula window
  finishes a partially typed constant name in the respective
  window. In the Formula window, Complete works only on the last
  term in the window. If the typed string has multiple completions,
  Complete displays a list of possible choices in a separate
  Completions window.

  <p>Once the assertion specification has been entered, the user
  presses the [<i>Run Template Assert</i>] button. Pressing this
  button causes Cyc to run the query that was entered at the "Query
  Specification" page and then to insert the bindings that are
  returned in the matching variable-slots of the assertion
  specification. Thus, if the query is of the form
  (<i>predicate1</i> <i>bound-argument</i> ?X) and the assert
  template is of the form (<i>predicate2</i> <i>bound-argument</i>
  ?X) in the microtheory <i>mt</i>, each binding returned by the
  query will be inserted as a replacement for X in an OE template
  of the form: (KE-ASSERT '(<i>predicate2</i> <i>bound-argument</i>
  X) '<i>mt</i> ':DEFAULT ':FORWARD). Thus, if the user asks for
  all the specializations of #$Dog that are known in the #$BaseKB
  by entering "#$BaseKB" in the "Mt:" window and "(#$genls ?X
  #$Dog)" in the "Query Specification:" window and pressing the
  [<i>Assert</i>] template button, then enters "#$BaseKB" and
  "(genls ?X #$Thing)" on the "Assert Specification" page, the user
  will be taken to a new page that looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
 
   Resulting Forms

   Current query in BaseKB :
   (genls ?X Dog)

   Current Assert Template in BaseKB :
   (genls ?X Thing)

   Operations:                                                                       OK?
   (KE-ASSERT '(genls (JuvenileFn Dog) Thing) 'BaseKB ':DEFAULT ':FORWARD)           [x]
   (KE-ASSERT '(genls (FemaleFn Dog) Thing) 'BaseKB ':DEFAULT ':FORWARD)             [x]
   (KE-ASSERT '(genls Dog Thing) 'BaseKB ':DEFAULT ':FORWARD)                        [x]  

</pre>The user can add all of the selected operations to the agenda
by pressing [<i>Add Forms to Agenda</i>]. An operation counts as
"selected" if the checkbox in its row under "OK?" is checked. By
default, all of the operations are selected.

  <h3>The [<i>Unassert</i>] Template</h3>Clicking on the
  [<i>Unassert</i>] button on the "Query Specification" page stores
  the query and takes the user to a template-building "Unassert
  Specification" page. Working with unassert templates is just like
  working with assert templates (see above), except the template
  specified is used to form unassert operations instead of assert
  operations. Thus, if the query entered on the "Query
  Specification" page is of the form (<i>predicate1</i>
  <i>bound-argument</i> ?X) and the unassert template entered on
  the "Unassert Specification" page the is of the form
  (<i>predicate2</i> <i>bound-argument</i> ?X) in the microtheory
  <i>mt</i>}, each binding returned by the query will be inserted
  as a replacement for X in an OE template of the form:
  (KE-UNASSERT '(<i>predicate2</i> <i>bound-argument</i> X)
  '<i>mt</i>). Thus, if the user asks for all the specializations
  of #$Dog that are known in the #$BaseKB by entering "#$BaseKB" in
  the "Mt:" window and "(#$genls ?X #$Dog)" in the "Query
  Specification:" window and pressing the [<i>Unassert</i>]
  template button, then enters "#$BaseKB" and "(genls ?X #$Dog)" on
  the "Unassert Specification" page, the user will be taken to a
  new page that looks like this:
  <pre>
 
   Resulting Forms
  
   Current query in BaseKB :
   (genls ?X Dog)

   Current Unassert Template in BaseKB :
   (genls ?X Dog)

   Operations:                                                                       OK?
   (KE-UNASSERT '(genls (JuvenileFn Dog) Dog) 'BaseKB)                               [x]
   (KE-UNASSERT '(genls (FemaleFn Dog) Dog) 'BaseKB)                                 [x]   
   (KE-UNASSERT '(genls Dog Dog) 'BaseKB)                                            [x] 

</pre>The user can add all of the selected operations to the agenda
by pressing [<i>Add Forms to Agenda</i>]. An operation counts as
"selected" if the box in its row under "OK?" is clicked. By
default, all of the operations are selected.

  <h3>The [<i>Blast</i>] Template</h3>Clicking on the
  [<i>Blast</i>] button on the "Query Specification" page stores
  the query and takes the user to a template-building "Unassert
  Specification" page. Working with blast templates is just like
  working with unassert templates, except that the forms generated
  are blast operations instead of unassert operations. Blasting is
  like unasserting, but it is slightly more general since
  unasserting directly removes only asserted assertions whereas
  blasting removes not only asserted assertions but also assertions
  that are deduced (e.g., the cached consequences of forward
  rules).

  <p>Thus, if the query entered on the "Query Specification" page
  is of the form (<i>predicate1</i> <i>bound-argument</i> ?X) and
  the blast template entered on the "Blast Specification" page the
  is of the form (<i>predicate2</i> <i>bound-argument</i> ?X) in
  the microtheory <i>mt</i>, each binding returned by the query
  will be inserted as a replacement for X in an OE template of the
  form: (FI-BLAST '(<i>predicate2</i> <i>bound-argument</i> X)
  '<i>mt</i>). Thus, if the user asks for all the specializations
  of #$Dog that are known in the #$BaseKB by entering "#$BaseKB" in
  the "Mt:" window and "(#$genls ?X #$Dog)" in the "Query
  Specification:" window and pressing the [<i>Blast</i>] template
  button, then enters "#$BaseKB" and "(genls ?X #$Dog)" on the
  "Blast Specification" page, the user will be taken to a new page
  that looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
 
   Resulting Forms
  
   Current query in BaseKB :
   (genls ?X Dog)

   Current Unassert Template in BaseKB :
   (genls ?X Dog)

   Operations:                                                                       OK?
   (FI-BLAST '(genls (JuvenileFn Dog) Dog) 'BaseKB)                                  [x]
   (FI-BLAST '(genls (FemaleFn Dog) Dog) 'BaseKB)                                    [x]
   (FI-BLAST '(genls Dog Dog) 'BaseKB)                                               [x] 

</pre>The user can add all of the selected operations to the agenda
by pressing [<i>Add Forms to Agenda</i>]. An operation counts as
"selected" if the checkbox in its row under "OK?" is checked. By
default, all of the operations are selected.

  <h3><a name="TMS">Performing TMS</a></h3>

  <p>Performing TMS (Truth-Maintenance) on an assertion essentially
  asks the system to reevaluate all of the arguments for that
  assertion. This is most useful when the assertion has a deduced
  source which depends on an HL (Heuristic Level) support which no
  longer holds. Thus, if an assertion looks like it has a stale HL
  support justifying it, performing TMS on it will make the stale
  argument go away.</p>

  <p>Choosing to perform full TMS on a constant involves performing
  TMS on every assertion involving the constant. Since this is
  potentially very time consuming (depending on the number of
  assertions involving the constant), this confirmation page
  appears as a precaution whenever the "Force TMS" link is selected
  in the Constant Index.</p>

  <p>The text in the middle of the confirmation page lists both the
  constant on which TMS is to be performed, as well as the number
  of assertions that will be affected if TMS is done. If this
  number is somewhat small (e.g., under several hundred), the time
  involved will be trivial; however, a larger number of assertions
  (e.g., several thousand) will require more time to complete.</p>

  <p>Press the [<i>Do it!</i>] button to force TMS on every
  assertion involving the given constant.</p>

  <p>Press the [<i>No</i>] button to abort the TMS operation and
  return to the Constant Index.</p>

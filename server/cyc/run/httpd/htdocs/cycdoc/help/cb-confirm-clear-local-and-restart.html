  <p>Since clearing the local queue will cause all operations in
  the queue to be discarded without being processed, and may result
  in loss of work, a confirmation is built into the system.</p>

  <p>To keep the local queue intact and return to the previous
  page, press the [<i>No</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To go ahead and delete the entire queue, press the [<i>Yes,
  Clear Local Queue and Restart Agenda</i>] button.</p>

  <p>If you want to keep a record of the operations in the local
  queue (e.g., to try running them again at some later time), press
  the [<i>No</i>] button to return to the previous page. Then view
  the contents of the local queue and copy some or all of the
  operations to a text file.</p>

  <p>Frequently, after clearing the local queue, the next step is
  to restart the agenda. If you select [<i>Yes, Clear Local Queue
  and Restart Agenda</i>], the agenda will be restarted once the
  local queue is gone.</p>

  <p>The Assertion Display Frame displays the details of a single
  CYC&reg; assertion, and allows the user to perform a number of
  operations on that assertion.</p>

  <p>Assertions in the KB are uniquely identified by an assertion
  ID number. This is listed at the top of the page. If the
  assertion is public (i.e., contains only public constants), the
  word public will appear to the left of the assertion ID.</p>

  <h3><a name="details" id="details">Assertion Details</a></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>"Truth" lists the truth value of the assertion, which can
    be True, False, or Unknown. Values of True or False will be
    followed by the strength of the truth value (default or
    monotonic).</li>

    <li>"Direction" lists the direction of the assertion, which can
    be Forward, Backward, or Code. Assertions with a direction of
    Code were not asserted to the KB, but rather are implemented in
    the SubL code, and as such cannot be edited via the
    Browser.</li>

    <li>"Arguments" lists the number of arguments that immediately
    support this assertion. Clicking on the link will display those
    arguments. This differs from Justify, which lists not only the
    first level of supports, but the entire chain of arguments back
    to local assertions or HL supports.</li>

    <li>"Dependents" is the converse of Arguments. It lists the
    number of assertions which depend upon the displayed assertion
    for their existence; these are the assertions which are
    reevaluated (and possibly deleted) if the displayed assertion
    is unasserted. Clicking on the "Dependents" link will display
    all of those assertions.</li>

    <li>"Mt" lists the <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>
    in which the assertion is true. If the same assertion is true
    in another microtheory as well, this is in effect a different
    assertion and will be listed separately under a different
    assertion ID.</li>

    <li>"HL Formula" lists the actual assertion as it is stored in
    the KB, if the HL form differs from the EL form. Most
    assertions are stored in their EL form, and thus no HL form
    will be listed.</li>

    <li>"EL Formula" lists the actual assertion in its EL form
    (usually the form of the rule when it was entered into the
    KB).</li>

    <li>"English Translation" provides an English version of the
    assertion, generated by CYC&reg;.</li>

    <li>"Meta Assertions" lists (meta) assertions about the
    assertion, if any. If the assertion has meta assertions about
    it, it will be marked with a yellow "M" <font color=
    "#FFFF00">M</font>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="operations" id="operations">Operations on
  Assertions</a></h3>

  <p>There are a number of different operations involving
  assertions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Change Mt" allows the user to change the <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>
    in which the assertion is true. This option will only appear
    for local assertions.</li>

    <li>"Change Strength" allows the user to change the strength of
    an assertion's truth value from Default to Monotonic and
    vice-versa. This option will only appear for local
    assertions.</li>

    <li>"Change Direction" allows the user to change the direction
    of an assertion from Backward to Forward and vice-versa.
    Remember that forward assertions are used in inference at
    assert time, while backward assertions are used in inference
    when a query which allows backchaining occurs. This option will
    only appear for local assertions.</li>

    <li>"Assert Similar" brings up an assertion editing window with
    a copy of the assertion in it as a default. The user can then
    modify the new copy before entering it into the KB.</li>

    <li>"Edit" brings up an assertion editing window with a copy of
    the assertion in it. The user can then modify the original
    assertion and commit the changes to the KB. In actuality, this
    causes the original assertion to be deleted, and a new but
    similar one to be asserted in its place. The new version of the
    assertion will have a different assertion ID number from the
    original. Attempts to reference the assertion via the old ID
    will not succeed. This option will only appear for local
    assertions.</li>

    <li>"Reassert" deletes the assertion and asserts it again. This
    option will only appear for local assertions.</li>

    <li>"Unassert" deletes the assertion from the KB, removing all
    of its dependents (conclusions that CYC&reg; has drawn from
    it). This option will only appear for local assertions.</li>

    <li>"Blast" removes deduced assertions from the KB, since they
    cannot be unasserted. All dependents are withdrawn, but the
    supports that led to the assertion's being concluded will
    remain in the KB. Blast is most often used in conjunction with
    exception rules (e.g., <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#exceptWhen">#$exceptWhen</a>),
    where an unwanted conclusion (for a specific case) is drawn
    from a general rule.</li>

    <li>"Redo TMS" forces full TMS (Truth-Maintenance) to be
    performed on the given assertion. Performing TMS on an
    assertion essentially asks the system to reevaluate all of the
    arguments for that assertion. This is most useful when the
    assertion has a deduced source which depends on an HL
    (Heuristic Level) support which no longer holds. Thus, if an
    assertion looks like it has a stale HL support justifying it,
    clicking on "Redo TMS" will make the stale argument go away.
    This link will only appear when an assertion has at least one
    HL support.</li>

    <li>"Justify" provides the justification chain for the
    assertion. If it's a local assertion, the Cyclist who asserted
    it will be cited as a source. If it's deduced, the assertions
    which led to its deduction will be displayed.</li>

    <li>"Recanonicalize" causes an uncanonical assertion to be
    recanonicalized. This option will only appear for local
    assertions.</li>

    <li>"Repropagate" causes the assertion to be used in inference
    immediately. This is akin to reasserting a forward rule into
    the KB.</li>

    <li>"Diagnose" performs low-level diagnostics on the assertion.
    This is only available in certain versions of the CYC&reg;
    System.</li>

    <li>"HL Data" displays a Heuristic Level (HL) description of
    the given assertion. This option is only available in certain
    versions of the CYC&reg; System.</li>
  </ul>

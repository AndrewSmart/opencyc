  <h3><a name="dependents">Assertion Dependents</a></h3>

  <p>Certain assertions in CYC&reg; are used to conclude new
  assertions. Those new assertions are the dependents of the
  original assertion, because they are dependent upon its existence
  for their own. If the original assertion is deleted, its
  dependents will also be deleted unless they can still be derived
  from another source.</p>

  <p>Dependents are essentially the converse of arguments. That is,
  if assertion A is an argument for assertion B, then B is a
  dependent of A. For more information on arguments, see the
  <a href="/cycdoc/help/cb-arguments.html">Arguments Help</a>.</p>

  <p>Not all assertions in CYC&reg; will have dependents, since
  many conclusions are not drawn until backchaining is applied
  during inference, and CYC&reg; does not necessarily permanently
  store those conclusions.</p>

  <p>This page lists the original assertion, followed by all of its
  immediate dependents. Each of the dependents is numbered, simply
  for reference by the user.</p>

  <p>A single dependent would be listed as follows:</p>
  <pre>
  1 : Deduced #3565200 supporting :
     [Dependent-Assertion-1]
</pre>Clicking on "Deduced" shows in more detail the argument
source for that deduced/dependent assertion.

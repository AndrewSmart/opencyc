  <p>This facility allows the user to enter new knowledge into the
  CYC&reg; KB using the KE Text format. For users unfamiliar with
  this special knowledge entry format, see the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/ref/ke-file.html">KE Text Documentation</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="compose">Composing KE Text</a></h3>

  <p>To enter new knowledge, simply type KE Text expressions into
  the input window, then press the [<i>Eval</i>] button. Remember
  to include a period after each expression, and place semi-colons
  in front of any comments (text not to be processed). Also
  remember that KE Text syntax does not use the "#$" in front of
  constant names.</p>

  <p>To take advantage of constant completion, type the first part
  of a CYC&reg; constant in the input window, then press the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button. Remember that a list of completions
  will appear in a separate HTML browser window if the completion
  is not unique.</p>

  <p>To clear the input field, press the [<i>Clear</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a name="options">Options for Compose</a></h3>

  <p>Compose KE Text contains two options. To set an option, simply
  click on the checkbox to the left of the option. When the
  [<i>Eval</i>] button is pressed, the selected option(s) will be
  used during the evaluation of the KE Text.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Remove non-printing characters in strings:</b> If this
    option is checked, then all characters occurring in CYC&reg;
    system strings in prospective entries (e.g., <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment">#$comment</a> strings,
    <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#cyclistNotes">#$cyclistNotes</a>
    strings, etc.) must have a character code between 31 and 127,
    or they will be replaced with a space at assert time. This
    means that with this option checked, all tabs, returns,
    linefeeds, and wacky Genera font characters occurring in
    CYC&reg; system strings will be replaced with an equal number
    of spaces. So if people want to include tabs and linefeeds in
    their <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment">#$comment</a> strings
    (possible, but not recommended), they should not check this
    option.</li>

    <li><b>Check for existing assertions:</b> If this option is
    checked, the user will be notified if an assertion they want to
    enter is already in the KB.. If it is not checked, then the
    user will not be so notified (and KE File will not go to the
    trouble of checking to see if the prospective entries are
    already in the KB). Generally speaking, it takes longer to
    check to see if assertions are already in the KB than to just
    evaluate a batch of (possibly redundant) entries. In general,
    no bad consequences result from evaluating a ke-assert for a
    form that is already in the KB. However, some people want to
    know if any of the assertions they are about to enter are
    already in the KB.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="processing">Processing KE Text</a></h3>

  <p>After the [<i>Eval</i>] button is pressed, the KE Text will be
  processed as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>CYC&reg; will check for any syntax errors, ask the user to
    fix those errors and retry.</li>

    <li>Any constants unknown to CYC&reg; will be collected, and
    the user will be asked if they want to make constants out of
    these strings. Click on "Make Constants" to confirm, or go back
    to make sure constant names have been entered correctly.</li>

    <li>Wait a few moments for the constants to be created before
    proceeding. If you proceed before CYC&reg; has had a chance to
    create all of the new constants, the CYC&reg; Agenda may get an
    error when processing certain operations.</li>

    <li>All expressions will be listed for review by the user.
    Confirm to proceed.</li>

    <li>The CYC&reg; Agenda will then process all operations in
    order. Errors will be handled depending on the Error Handling
    Mode selected. To set the Error Handling Mode, click on the
    "Mode" link in the Agenda Status Bar.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The Load API Expressions Page allows the user to load a file
  of SubL forms (e.g., ke-assert, ke-unassert, ke-create,
  ke-rename, etc.), to be processed by the CYC&reg; Agenda. Forms
  in the file will be loaded and executed one by one. This is very
  similar to dropping the forms one at a time into the SubL
  Interactor. The benefit of using Load API is that an entire file
  can be loaded at once, thus speeding up the knowledge-entry
  process.</p>

  <h3><a name="loading">Loading a File</a></h3>

  <p>To load a file for evaluation, enter a filename in the input
  window (e.g., /foo/bar/bam.text). Then press the [<i>Load
  File</i>] button. Forms from the file will be loaded and executed
  one by one until the program either:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Encounters an FI error</li>

    <li>Successfully processes all loaded operations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These two situations are described in the <a href=
  "#results">Understanding the Results</a> section below.</p>

  <p>To clear the input window and start over, press the
  [<i>Clear</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a name="results">Understanding the Results</a></h3>

  <p>Results of the load will be printed on the API Load Results
  page.</p>

  <p>The name of the loaded file will be listed, along with a
  summarization of the results (i.e., whether all operations were
  processed, or whether an error was encountered which caused the
  load to halt). If the entire file was loaded successfully, no
  more information will be listed on this page. If an error was
  encountered, the error will be listed and explained, and the user
  will have the option of continuing to load the file. (The
  offending operation can be included or excluded during
  continuation; see the <a href="#form-number">Form Number</a>
  section below for details.)</p>

  <h4><a name="error">The Error</a></h4>

  <p>If an error caused the load to halt, you'll see a message
  like:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "An error occurred after processing 3 forms."<br>
    Last operation: (KE-CREATE "Collection") Already a constant
    called Collection
  </blockquote>The number returned is the number of successful
  operations executed before the error occurred. This number does
  not include the error itself. Thus in the example above, 3
  operations were successfully processed before the error.

  <p>"Last operation" lists the operation which caused the error,
  followed by an explanation of why the error occurred. In the
  example above, creation of the constant <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection">#$Collection</a>
  caused an error because there was already a constant by that name
  in the KB.</p>

  <h4><a name="form-number">Form Number</a></h4>

  <p>The Form Number is the number of operations to skip when
  continuing with the file load. For example, a Form Number of 17
  would cause the program to skip the first 17 forms in the file,
  and begin by processing the 18th form.</p>

  <p>The default value for this window will be the total number of
  operations processed in the file before the error occurred. So in
  the example in the <a href="#error">Error</a> section above, the
  default value would be 3. Simply continuing without changing this
  number or fixing the error will cause the load to stop at the
  same place again. Thus there are two options:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>Fix the error:</i> if you fix (or comment out) the error
    in the file and want to try again, leave the Form Number at its
    default value. Be sure to save the file after making any
    changes.</li>

    <li><i>Skip the offending operation and start with the next
    one:</i> to do this, simply add 1 to the default value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a name="file">KE File Name</a></h4>

  <p>The KE File Name lists the file to load on the next try. In
  most cases, this will be the same file as before, and this input
  window should be left as is. If you do want to load a different
  file than the previous one, simply change the filename in the
  input window. In this case, be sure to change the Form Number to
  0, to ensure that the new file is loaded from the beginning.</p>

  <p>To continue loading the original file (after fixing the error
  or changing the Form Number), or to load a new file (after
  changing the KE File Name), press the [<i>Load File</i>]
  button.</p>

  <p>If you change the values in the input windows and wish to
  reset them to their default values before editing, press the
  [<i>Reset</i>] button.</p>

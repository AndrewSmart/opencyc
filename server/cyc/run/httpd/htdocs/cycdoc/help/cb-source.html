  <p>This page provides a little more detail about the argument
  sources for a deduced assertion than the Arguments page.</p>

  <p>The detailed description of an argument source contains three
  sections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Assertion Supported" is the assertion which is derived by
    CYC&reg; from the arguments which follow.</li>

    <li>"Argument Truth" is the truth value and strength of the
    argument provided.</li>

    <li>"Argument Supports" are the assertions in CYC&reg; whose
    combination resulted in the assertion at the top of the page
    being concluded by CYC&amp;reg.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If an argument for a deduced assertion originated via a
  special HL-module, the name of that module (e.g. :ISA) will
  apppear in place of the standard colored ball in front of the
  argument.</p>

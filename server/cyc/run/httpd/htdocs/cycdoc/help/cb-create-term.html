  <p>This page allows the user to create a new CYC&reg; term, with
  documentation and lexification. For a more spartan interface to
  create constants, see the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/help/cb-create.html">Create Constant Help</a>
  documentation.</p>

  <h3><a name="create" id="create">Creating New Constants</a></h3>

  <p>To create a new constant in the KB, enter the name the new
  constant will have (minus the "#$"), then press the [<i>Create
  Constant</i>] button. If a constant already exists by that name,
  a message will appear to that effect.</p>

  <p>To see if any existing constants have similar beginnings,
  enter the intial part of the name into the window and press the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button. Possible completions will be displayed
  in a separate completion window which will be reused for future
  completions. Completion is case sensitive, and requires that
  JavaScript is enabled in your browser.</p>

  <p>To clear any of the entry fields in the window and start over,
  press the [<i>Clear</i>] button. To clear all of the entry fields
  together, press the [<i>Reset All Fields</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To abort out of the create constant option and return to the
  previous frame, press the [<i>Cancel Create</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a name="comment" id="comment">Providing a Comment</a></h3>

  <p>For every constant that is created, it is important to provide
  a descriptive English <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment">#$comment</a> about it.
  The Create Term window provides a multi-line entry field for
  specifying such a comment. To use the completion window from
  within the comment's multi-line entry field, use the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button above the entry field, adjacent to the
  <b>comment</b> label. To clear the entry field in the window and
  start over, press the [<i>Clear</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a name="termStrings" id="termStrings">Providing Natural
  Language Information</a></h3>

  <p>Constants that are to participate in natural language
  understanding require lexification. The most straight-forward way
  of lexification is to provide a term string for a Cyc term. The
  Create Term window has a multi-line entry field for specifying
  term strings; each line is interpreted as one term string for the
  newly created Cyc term. To clear the entry field in the window
  and start over, press the [<i>Clear</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a name="next-steps" id="next-steps">Next Steps</a></h3>

  <p>Once a term has been successfully created, provided with a
  comment and natural language lexification, the term needs to be
  positioned in the ontology. The Create Term page therefore hands
  off to the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/help/cb-categorize-term.html">Categorize Term</a>
  page.</p>

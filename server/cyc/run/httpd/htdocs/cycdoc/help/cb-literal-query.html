  <p>The Term Index lists only a limited number of GAFs that
  involve a given constant, primarily those GAFs which were
  asserted locally (e.g., entered by a human user). To compute more
  GAFs of a given type, click on the "plus" symbol next to the
  desired relation. This will activate the Literal Query tool.</p>

  <h3><a name="query">Literal Queries</a></h3>

  <p>The Literal Query tool asks CYC&reg; to try and compute (via
  HL modules and other means) more GAFs of the specified type; the
  results are displayed as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Last query" specifies which atomic formula (in which
    <a href=
    "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>)
    is being expanded upon.</li>

    <li>"Bindings" specifies over which argument the computation is
    taking place (this should match the variable in the query), and
    displays every possible binding for that argument.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, suppose <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/agent-vocab.html#Agent">#$Agent</a> is displayed
  in the KB Browser. Clicking on the "genls" link in the Term Index
  under "Arg 1" will list only locally asserted supersets of
  <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/agent-vocab.html#Agent">#$Agent</a>. We
  can produce a list of all supersets of <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/agent-vocab.html#Agent">#$Agent</a> by clicking on
  the green "plus" symbol next to "genls" in the Term Index; this
  should produce the following Literal Query:</p>
  <pre>
  Last query in BaseKB :
  (genls Agent ?ARG2)

  Bindings for ?ARG2 :
  Agent   CompositeTangibleAndIntangibleObject  
  PartiallyIntangible   PartiallyTangible   SomethingExisting  
  TemporalThing   SpatialThing   Individual   Thing      

  Examine the inference tree ... 
</pre>The meaning of which is that <a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/agent-vocab.html#Agent">#$Agent</a> has <a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#PartiallyTangible">#$PartiallyTangible</a>,
<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#SpatialThing">#$SpatialThing</a>,
etc. as supersets.

  <p>"Examine the inference tree" is a link to the Inference Tree
  Examiner, which provides a detailed look at the inferencing
  performed during the search.</p>

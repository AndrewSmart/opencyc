  This tool allows the user to create a new constant similar to the
  displayed constant, and to choose which of the assertions
  involving the displayed constant to copy over to the new
  constant. Copying assertions over to a new constant simply means
  that the new assertions will have the new constant name
  substituted in for the old.

  <p>To create a new constant similar to the selected constant,
  proceed as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Enter the name of the new constant into the input window.
    This must be a new constant name. If the new constant name is
    similar to an existing constant, you can take advantage of
    constant completion by completing on the existing constant name
    and then editing to create the new constant name.</li>

    <li>All copiable assertions involving the selected constant are
    displayed at the bottom of the page. Select the assertions that
    you wish to copy over to the new constant by selecting the
    check boxes to the left of the assertions.</li>

    <li>Press the [<i>Create Similar</i>] button. This will create
    the new constant and copy over the selected assertions.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To clear the input field and start over, press the
  [<i>Clear</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To cancel the creation of a new constant and return to the
  previous page, press the [<i>Cancel Create</i>] button.</p>

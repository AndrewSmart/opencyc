  <h3><a name="arguments">Assertion Arguments</a></h3>

  <p>Every assertion in the CYC&reg; KB has arguments which
  immediately support its existence in the KB. This page displays a
  selected assertion, followed by the arguments which support it.
  If an argument for an assertion is removed from the KB, then the
  assertion is removed as well, unless it can still be derived via
  other arguments.</p>

  <p>Arguments are essentially the converse of dependents. That is,
  if assertion A is an argument for assertion B, then B is a
  dependent of A. For more information on dependents, see the
  <a href="/cycdoc/help/cb-dependents.html">Dependents Help</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="types">Local vs. Deduced Arguments</a></h3>

  <p>Assertions in CYC&reg; (as reflected by their arguments) come
  in two flavors: local or deduced.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Local: local assertions are those that are asserted by some
    source outside of CYC&reg;, most likely a human user. Arguments
    for these kinds of assertions are of the form:
      <pre>
  Asserted locally by Fred on Nov 25, 1996
</pre>In other words, the displayed assertion is true because Fred
asserted it.
    </li>

    <li>Deduced: deduced assertions are those that are derived from
    other knowledge in the KB. Arguments for these kinds of
    assertions are of the form:
      <pre>
  Argument : Deduced #10657786

    [Supporting-Argument-1]
    [Supporting-Argument-2]
</pre>In other words, the combination of [Supporting-Argument-1]
and [Supporting-Argument-2] result in the displayed assertion being
concluded by CYC&reg;. Deduced assertions cannot be deleted;
instead, use the "Blast" tool accessible from the Assertion Display
Frame.

      <p>If an argument for a deduced assertion originated via a
      special HL-module, the name of that module (e.g. :ISA) will
      apppear in place of the standard colored ball in front of the
      argument.</p>

      <p>Clicking on the "Deduced" link will display the argument
      source in more detail.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

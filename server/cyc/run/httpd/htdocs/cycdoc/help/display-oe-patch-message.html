  <p>Cycorp's policy for submitting transcripts is to send out
  patch messages to the <a href="mailto:oe@cyc.com">oe</a> mailing
  list whenever there is any substantive change to the Cyc KB.
  Additionally, if you are making a patch that includes changes
  which may be important to others (e.g. programmers), you should
  also add that group the recipient list.</p>

  <h3>Transcripts with operations from multiple users</h3>

  <p>When sending patch messages for transcripts with operations
  from multiple users, it can be difficult to write a good message.
  Therefore, it is recommended that OEers try to avoid such
  transcripts. For example, when working on a shared image, it is
  best to start with a fresh transcript (e.g. by transmitting
  what's already there for an image designated for transmission)
  and then quickly do your work and transmit it (e.g. by loading
  the KE file and then transmitting). In cases where there are
  already operations from multiple users, write the patch message
  for your portion of the work, and also mention in the patch
  message who else has operations in that transcript.</p>

  <h3>Patch Messages</h3>

  <p>It is recommended that you look through the transcript (using
  the link at the top of the OE Patch Message page) to double-check
  the transcript and make sure it doesn't include any operations
  that you don't want to transmit.</p>

  <p>The patch message screen consists of these major sections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>To:</b> The recipients of the patch message. For
    additional recipients, add new addresses (separated by commas)
    to this field.</li>

    <li><b>Short Description:</b> This will be the subject line of
    the email patch message. It should be informative enough for
    mail recipients to determine whether they need to read the rest
    of the message. If the transcript is addressing a bug, the bug
    number should be included here.</li>

    <li><b>Patch Message:</b> This includes a more detailed
    description of the purpose of the transcript, and any other
    information that readers of the message should know (e.g. it
    contains operations that will change the way the canonicalizer
    operates or includes the creation of a new suite of rule-macro
    predicates, changes to the meaning of existing predicates,
    etc.). It typically also includes some information about the
    motivation for the work. At the end of the message is an
    automatically-generated section that provides information about
    the transcript, including number of operations, any constants
    created (and their comments, if they have any), and any
    constants that are killed or renamed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Finishing the Patch</h3>

  <p>When you are finished with the message, clicking on "Transmit
  and Send Patch Message" will send the message and the transcript.
  In cases where there no constant creations or kills, another
  button will appear ("Transmit without Patch Message"). That
  button is is intended only for use when the content of the
  transcript is too trivial to bother OEers with (e.g. when you fix
  a typo in a comment). If the button does not appear, the only way
  to transmit without sending a patch message is to remove all the
  email-addresses from the "To:" field.</p>

  <h3><a name="kill">Killing a Constant</a></h3>

  <p>Killing a constant removes it from the KB; any assertions
  which involve it are also removed. The number of assertions
  involving the constant will be listed along with the constant to
  be killed.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to reverse a kill (short of creating a new
  constant by the same name and reasserting every assertion which
  involved the old constant), so it is very important to be sure
  that killing is what is desired.</p>

  <p>To remove the constant from the KB and delete all assertions
  involving it, press the [<i>Yes, Kill</i>] button. The number of
  assertions that will be removed are listed just above the
  confirmation buttons.</p>

  <p>To leave the constant intact and return to the previous frame,
  press the [<i>No</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a name="recreate">Recreating a Constant</a></h3>

  <p>Killing a constant removes it from the KB entirely. If a new
  constant is then created with the same name (i.e., the constant
  was killed to remove all of its assertions and allow the user to
  start over), it will be created with a new constant ID but the
  same name, which might be problematic.</p>

  <p>A better approach is to use the Recreate Constant tool, which
  removes from the KB all of the assertions involving that
  constant, while leaving the constant itself intact. This is a
  much cleaner and safer way to start over.</p>

  <p>To reach the Recreate Constant tool, click on the "Recreate"
  link.</p>

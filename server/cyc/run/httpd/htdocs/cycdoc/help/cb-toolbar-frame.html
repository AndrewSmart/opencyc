  <p>The Toolbar Frame allows the user to do three things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Search for constants using the input window.</li>

    <li>Navigate around the KB Browser via the "Tools" and
    "Navigator" links.</li>

    <li>Access the user login facility via the "Login" link.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="layout">Toolbar Layout</a></h3>

  <p>The layout of the Toolbar depends on whether JavaScript is
  enabled or not. With JavaScript on, there will be a single,
  multi-purpose window (for options 1-4 below); CYC&reg; constant
  completion (described below) will also be possible. With
  JavaScript off, there will be two windows--one for options 1 and
  3 (left-hand window), one for option 4 (right-hand window);
  CYC&reg; constant completion will not be available (thus option 2
  below is not possible), since it requires JavaScript to run.</p>

  <p>JavaScript can be turned on and off on the Browser Options
  page, accessible by clicking on the "Options" link on the Toolbar
  or Browser Tools page.</p>

  <p>JavaScript is not enabled by default because certain HTML
  browsers do not support it fully. To configure your KB Browser to
  the capabilities of your HTML browser, go to the CYC&reg; Main
  Menu (click the "Navigator" link to go to the CYC&reg; Navigator)
  and click on "Browser Setup". The system will determine if your
  HTML browser supports JavaScript and frames, and configure your
  KB Browser accordingly.</p>

  <h3><a name="searching">Searching for constants in the
  KB:</a></h3>

  <p>There are four ways to search using the input window:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Enter a complete constant name, then press the
    [<i>Show</i>] button. (Use the left-hand window with JavaScript
    off.) There are four versions of this search:

      <ul>
        <li>Entering a constant name without "#$" (e.g. Foo) uses a
        case-insensitive lookup, with help from the lexicon.</li>

        <li>Entering a constant name with "#$" (e.g. #$Foo) uses
        exact, case-sensitive lookup.</li>

        <li>If an entry is preceded by a left parenthesis (e.g.
        (#$FooFn #$Bar)), an exact, case-sensitive lookup is used
        to find the specified reified <a href=
        "/cycdoc/ref/glossary.html#NAT">NAT</a>.</li>

        <li>If an entry is in double quotes (e.g. "foo bar"), the
        system uses only the lexicon to find constants. This option
        is only available in versions of CYC&reg; containing the
        lexicon code.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ul>
    <li>Enter the first part of a constant name and press the
    [<i>Complete</i>] button. Then press the [<i>Show</i>] button.
    Possible completions will be displayed in a separate completion
    window which will be reused for future completions. Completion
    is case sensitive, and requires that JavaScript is enabled in
    your browser. (This option is not available with JavaScript
    turned off.)</li>

    <li>Enter a substring of a constant name, using "*" as a
    wildcard at the tail end of the string (or at both ends) to
    represent unspecified characters in the string. Then press the
    [<i>Show</i>] button. Substrings must be at least 3 characters
    long for this to work. (Use the left-hand window with
    JavaScript off.)</li>

    <li>Enter a <a href="/cycdoc/help/grep-chart.html">UNIX regular
    expression</a> and press the [<i>GREP</i>] button. Clicking on
    the "Ignore Case" button causes the GREP search to become
    case-insensitive, unclicking makes it sensitive to case. The
    default setting is to ignore case. In general, the GREP search
    is faster than the wildcard method mentioned above. However,
    since the constant search list for the GREP facility is only
    updated when a new CYC&reg; world is created, the wildcard
    method may reflect changes to constant names faster than the
    GREP facility. For help with UNIX regular expressions, click
    <a href="/cycdoc/help/grep-chart.html">here</a>. (Use the right-hand window
    with JavaScript off.) If any of the above searches yields more
    than one possible constant, a list of constants will be
    displayed. Clicking on the desired constant will display the
    entry for that constant.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="navigating">Navigating Around the KB
  Browser</a></h3>

  <p>To reach other tools accessible from the KB Browser, click on
  the "Tools" link. This will take you to the Browser Tools page,
  where you can either continue on to another tool, or modify the
  Browser Toolbar so that links to desired tools appear directly in
  the Toolbar Frame, thus becoming more readily accessible.</p>

  <p>The help page page for the Browser Tools explains each of the
  available tools in more detail.</p>

  <p>The CYC&reg; Navigator is a useful launching pad for accessing
  the rest of the CYC&reg; System. To reach it, simply click on the
  "Navigator" link on the Toolbar or Browser Tools pages.</p>

  <p>Interface preferences for the KB Browser can be set by going
  to the Browser Options page, accessible via the "Options" link on
  the Toolbar or Browser Tools pages.</p>

  <h3><a name="login">Login</a></h3>

  <p>In order to fully access all areas of the KB Browser, it is
  necessary to first login as a CYC&reg; user. The "Login" link in
  the Toolbar lists the current user, and connects to the Login
  Area, where new users can login to CYC&reg;.</p>

  <h3><a name="other">Other Information</a></h3>

  <p>Clicking on "Update" refreshes the Toolbar Frame. This link
  will not appear if JavaScript is turned off. If frames are not
  being used, this link will also not appear; use the "Update" link
  in the Agenda Status Bar to refresh the entire page.</p>

  <p>"Machine" lists the machine on which the CYC&reg; Process is
  running.</p>

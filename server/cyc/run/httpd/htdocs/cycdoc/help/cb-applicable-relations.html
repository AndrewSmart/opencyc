  <p>Applicable Relations provides a list of every relation for
  which the given term could possibly be an argument.</p>

  <p>The list is organized into sections based on which argument
  position the term could occupy (e.g., "Arg 1", "Arg 2", "Arg 3").
  Every term will have <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa">#$isa</a> under its
  Arg 1 section. All binary predicates will have <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg1Isa">#$arg1Isa</a>
  under their Arg 1 section and <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg2Isa">#$arg2Isa</a>
  under their Arg 2 section. Particular places (e.g.,
  #$CityOfParisFrance) will have <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#eventOccursAt">#$eventOccursAt</a>
  under their Arg 2 section, and particular agents (e.g., #$Lenat)
  will have <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#doneBy">#$doneBy</a>
  under their Arg 2 section.</p>

  <p>Within each section, relations are sorted very roughly as
  follows: more specific relations come first in the list and more
  general ones come later.</p>

  <p>Next to some relations in the list are "+" links for
  processing that relation using the Literal Query tool. In
  general, the Literal Query tool asks CYC&reg; to compute more
  queries of a specific type. (See the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/help/cb-literal-query.html">Literal Query Help</a> for details.)</p>

  <p>Example: if #$Lenat is displayed in the KB Browser, and we
  click on Applicable Relations, we will see every relation in
  CYC&reg; that could possibly applyto Lenat. One of those
  relations should be <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#mother">#$mother</a>. Clicking
  on the "+" next to mother will initiate the ask:</p>
  <pre>
  (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#mother">#$mother</a> #$Lenat ?ARG2)
</pre>to see if CYC&reg; can compute any bindings for that value.

  <p>The different colors specify the likelihood that an answer can
  be concluded:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <img src="/cycdoc/img/cb/plus-yellow.gif" alt=
    "a yellow plus sign"> : CYC&reg; already has assertions
    asserted and indexed like this.<br>
    <img src="/cycdoc/img/cb/plus-green.gif" alt=
    "a green plus sign"> : CYC&reg; has HL methods available which
    make it VERY likely an answer can be calculated.<br>
    <img src="/cycdoc/img/cb/plus-purple.gif" alt=
    "a purple plus sign"> : It's possible but unlikely that a value
    can be calculated.<br>
    No + : There's no way for CYC&reg; to conclude this relation.

  <p>The Index Overlap facility allows the user to search the
  CYC&reg; KB for assertions that share two or more terms. (To find
  assertions that involve only one specified term, simply look at
  the entry for that constant in the KB Browser.)</p>

  <h3><a name="search">Index Overlap Search</a></h3>

  <p>To find assertions indexed by a set of terms, simply enter
  into the input window all of the terms, separated by a space.
  Terms may be typed in with or without the "#$" prefix. Then press
  the [<i>Search</i>] button. For example, to find all assertions
  that contain both <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a> and
  #$BarkingSound, just enter:</p>
  <pre>
  Dog   BarkingSound
</pre>An Index Overlap search can involve any number of terms,
though searches involving 2 or 3 terms are most common.

  <p>To complete a constant name while typing it, press the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To clear the input window and start over, press the
  [<i>Clear</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a name="results">Index Overlap Results</a></h3>

  <p>The Index Overlap Results page has two sections: "Search
  Terms" and "Index Overlap".</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Search Terms" restates the terms used in the search. If a
    constant name was mistyped, and therefore wasn't used in the
    search, it will not be listed here. If only 1 term was given as
    input (or 2 were, but 1 was entered incorrectly, etc.), you'll
    be asked to try again using more than one search term.</li>

    <li>"Index Overlap" lists every assertions in the KB which
    contain all of the Search Terms listed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note: Index Overlap only acts at the HL level, looking at the
  HL formulas for assertions indexed off of the terms you give it.
  So if the assertion can't be seen from each of the terms given,
  it won't be seen in the overlap.</p>

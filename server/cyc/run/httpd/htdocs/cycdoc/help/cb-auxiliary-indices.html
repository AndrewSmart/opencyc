  <h3><a name="indices">Auxiliary Indices</a></h3>

  <p>Most uses of the CYC&reg; KB Browser involve using the
  standard Term Index for viewing assertions involving a displayed
  constant. However, in addition to this main index, there may be
  several other indices available for viewing assertions, depending
  on the version of CYC&reg; being used. These indices, if
  available, are listed on the Auxiliary Indices page.</p>

  <p>To select an auxiliary index, simply click on its name in the
  list. The Main Display Frame will appear as usual, but the
  indexing scheme/content will be different.</p>

  <p>To return to the standard Term Index, simply choose a constant
  to display, either through the Toolbar or by clicking on the
  highlighted constant. If the constant cannot be displayed via the
  selected auxiliary index (most cannot), the standard Term Index
  will be used.</p>

  <p>The System Area provides detailed information about the system
  settings of the current CYC&reg; image, operations queues, and
  transcripts, as well as allowing the user to perform operations
  such as halting the CYC&reg; image or loading CYC&reg;
  patches.</p>

  <h3><a name="settings">System Settings</a></h3>

  <p>"Current machine" shows the machine the CYC&reg; image is
  running on.</p>

  <p>"Current image number" shows the particular image number
  (uniquely identified by the date the CYC&reg; image was started
  up on this particular machine). For example,</p>
  <pre>
        CLIO-1-19970505093744
</pre>means that the CYC&reg; image was started up on Clio on May
5, 1997 at 9:37:44am.

  <p>"Image start time" displays the date and time the image was
  started and how long the image has been up and running.</p>

  <p>"Current KB" lists the current version of the Knowledge Base,
  and will be updated when KB operations are loaded into the
  current CYC&reg; image. Generally, a new CYC&reg; image will be
  started up with a whole-number KB version (this number appears
  next to "KB" in the System Status frame at the bottom of the
  screen). Then, the number to the right of the decimal will match
  the total number of trancript operations that have been read
  (line #1 below). For example,</p>
  <pre>
        93.1064
</pre>would usually mean that the current image was started up with
KB 93, and a total of 1064 operations have been read (but not
necessarily processed). To see how many operations have been
processed, see the <a href="#queues">Operations Queues</a> section
below for an explanation.

  <p>"System and patch level" lists the current version of the SubL
  code, including the patch level. For example,</p>
  <pre>
        41.19
</pre>means that the CYC&reg; image is based on version 41 of the
SubL code, and the patch level (number of updates to this version
of the SubL code) is 19.

  <p><b>C, NT, LISP (LispWorks/Allegro) images:</b> clicking on
  "here" in the tagline at the bottom of this section will halt the
  CYC&reg; image; there is a safety confirmation built into this
  option, since unintentionally halting the CYC&reg; image will
  most likely have undesired consequences. LISP (Genera) images are
  generally not halted using the HTML interface; instead, LISP
  (Genera) machines are controlled via the command line interface
  on the LISP machine, which is best left up to those familiar with
  the LISP (Genera) machines.</p>

  <p><b>LISP (Genera) images:</b> clicking on "here" in the tagline
  at the bottom of this section will load patches, effectively
  bringing the SubL code up-to-date for the CYC&reg; image. Loading
  patches is part of the CYC&reg; Agenda's job, though it is
  occasionally necessary or desirable to load them by hand. C, NT,
  and LISP (LispWorks/Allegro) images do not load patches, instead
  catching up when a new world is built at compile time.</p>

  <h3><a name="queues">Queue Information</a></h3>

  <p>This section offers a more detailed description of the
  operations queues that appear in the Agenda Status Bar. There are
  3 queues,</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Remote: operations originating on other machines.</li>

    <li>Local: operations originating on the local CYC&reg;
    image.</li>

    <li>Auxiliary: special queue for use during KB dumps.</li>
  </ul>broken up into 3 sections, starting at the top:

  <ol>
    <li>Remote

      <ul>
        <li>The number of operations from the remote queue that
        have been read but not yet processed. These operations will
        not yet have had any effect on the local image.</li>

        <li>The total number of operations processed by the local
        CYC&reg; image, regardless of origin. This includes both
        remote and local operations, regardless of whether they
        caused an error in the CYC&reg; Agenda.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Local

      <ul>
        <li>The number of operations on the local queue which have
        yet to be processed. These operations will not yet have had
        any effect on the local image.</li>

        <li>The number of operations which have been processed by
        the local image, but not yet recorded. The changes effected
        by these operations will be evident in the local
        image.</li>

        <li>The number of operations originating in the local
        CYC&reg; image that have been processed and recorded. Only
        operations showing up here will be added to the master
        transcript if processed operations are sent.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Auxiliary (will only appear if queue is non-empty)

      <ul>
        <li>The number of operations from the auxiliary queue that
        have been processed by the local image.</li>

        <li>The number of operations from the auxiliary queue that
        have been read but not yet processed. These operations will
        not yet have had any effect on the local image.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="transcripts">Transcript
  Information</a></h3>Depending on the communication status,
  operations processed by a CYC&reg; image may be written out to a
  special file called a transcript file. For every image, there are
  two relevant kinds of transcript files:

  <ul>
    <li>Master Transcript: the trancript file common to all
    CYC&reg; images on a given network. Processed operations which
    are transmitted are added to this file. Operations received
    from others are read from this file.</li>

    <li>Local Transcript: the transcript file specifically for the
    local image.to which the CYC&reg; Agenda is writing operations.
    If the Agenda is storing operations for later, locally
    originating processed operations will be written to this file.
    This filename is often the one to use when loading a transcript
    manually via the "Load Transcript File" link in the CYC&reg;
    Navigator.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To view the contents of either the Master or Local Transcript,
  simply click on the highlighted name. A word of caution: the
  master transcript can get a bit long, and so may take some time
  to load.</p>

  <p>Below the name of the Master Transcript, the number of
  characters and estimated number of operations in the transcript
  are displayed. The actual number of operations read is listed as
  well.</p>

  <p>Below the name of the Local Transcript, the number of
  operations in the file is listed.</p>

  <p>If either transcript has 0 operations, it is empty.</p>

  <h3><a name="history">Historical Information</a></h3>At the
  bottom of the System Area, a summary of queue/transcript
  information is presented:

  <ul>
    <li>Total number of operations from the remote queue that were
    processed by the local image.</li>

    <li>Total number of operations from the local queue that were
    processed by the local image.</li>

    <li>Total number of operation that originated in the local
    image that were sent to the Master Transcript.</li>

    <li>Total number of operations from the auxiliary queue that
    were processed by the local image.</li>
  </ul>For details on communication status settings and transcript
  files, see the <a href="/cycdoc/ref/system.html">CYC&reg; Agenda and
  Transcripts Documentation</a>.

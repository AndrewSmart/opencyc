  <p>The Cyc OWL Ontology Importer is a tool for creating or
  updating a mirror of an OWL ontology in a Cyc KB. A Cyc term
  representing the OWL ontology itself is specified or created, and
  each term defined in the OWL ontology is linked (via a
  #$synonymousExternalConcept assertion) to the ontology and to a
  new or existing Cyc term.</p>

  <h3><a name="uri" id="uri">Ontology URI</a></h3>

  <p>Each OWL ontology should have a globally unique, persistent
  uniform resource identifier (URI) by which it can be referenced.
  Typically, this is a uniform resource locator (URL). If you are
  importing an ontology that can be downloaded from its URI, the
  importer will do so. Otherwise, you must provide an OWL file that
  contains the definition of the OWL ontology.</p>

  <h3><a name="terms" id="terms">New Terms and Prefix</a></h3>

  <p>When the importer encounters a term definition in the OWL
  file, it will check to see if there is an existing Cyc term
  associated with the term's name and ontology. If no such term
  exists, it will create a new term, prefixed with the prefix you
  specify. For instance, if you give the prefix "FOO-", then for a
  term in your ontology named "Bar", it will create a new Cyc
  constant #$FOO-Bar.</p>

  <p>If a different constant with that name already exists, it will
  add a suffix to the end to uniquify it, e.g. #$FOO-Bar-8. In
  keeping with Cyc naming conventions, if a new predicate is
  created (i.e. for an OWL property), the first letter of its
  constant name will be lowercase. New non-predicates (for OWL
  classes and non-property instances thereof) will get a constant
  name whose first character is uppercase.</p>

  <h3><a name="placement" id="placement">Placement in the Cyc
  Ontology</a></h3>

  <p>Some basic OWL concepts (e.g. #$OWLClass and #$OWLProperty)
  are already placed in the Cyc ontology and associated with the
  URIs of their external ontologies and their names therein. Thus,
  if your ontology contains, for example, instances of
  owl:SymmetricProperty, the corresponding Cyc term will be an
  instance of #$OWLSymmetricProperty, and, via transitivity, of
  #$SymmetricBinaryPredicate.</p>

  <p>OWL subClass and subProperty relations are imported using
  spec-predicates of #$genls and #$genlPreds, so once an imported
  OWL class or property is merged with or asserted to be a
  specialization of an existing Cyc collection or predicate, then
  the entire hierarchy below it is incorporated as well.</p>

  <p>The rdf:domain and rdf:range properties are interpreted as
  argument constraints (using spec-predicates of #$arg1Isa and
  #$arg2Isa), and the various kinds of restrictions in OWL are
  imported using rule-macro predicates such as #$interArgIsa1-2 and
  #$relationAllExists.</p>

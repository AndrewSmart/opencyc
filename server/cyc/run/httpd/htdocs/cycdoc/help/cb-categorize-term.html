  <p>This page allows the user to minimally position a newly
  created CYC&reg; term in the Cyc ontology by assigning it to one
  collection that the term is an instance of, and (so applicable)
  one collection that the term specializes.</p>

  <p>Press the [<i>Categorize</i>] button when all applicable
  fields have been filled in.</p>

  <p>To clear any of the entry fields in the window and start over,
  press the [<i>Clear</i>] button. To clear all of the entry fields
  together, press the [<i>Reset All Fields</i>] button.</p>

  <h3><a href="displaying">The Term</a></h3>

  <p>The page shows the term undergoing categorization at the top,
  together with its comment.</p>

  <p><i>Note:</i> Existing terms can be re-categorized, but this
  page does not show similar terms, instance or specialization
  information already asserted about this term.</p>

  <h3><a href="microtheory">Mt</a></h3>

  <p>Enter the microtheory (minus the "#$") in which the
  categorizations are to be asserted. To take advantage of constant
  completion, enter a partial microtheory name and press the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button. Remember that a list of completions
  will appear in a separate HTML browser window if the completion
  is not unique.</p>

  <h3><a href="similar">Similar To</a></h3>

  <p>Use this field to enter a term (minus the "#$") that is
  similar to the term being categorized. To take advantage of
  constant completion, enter a partial term name and press the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button. Remember that a list of completions
  will appear in a separate HTML browser window if the completion
  is not unique.</p>

  <h3><a href="instance">Instance Of</a></h3>

  <p>Use this field to enter the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/ref/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection">collection</a>
  (minus the "#$") of which this term is an instance. All terms
  must be at minimum instances of #$Thing. To take advantage of
  constant completion, enter a partial term name and press the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button. Remember that a list of completions
  will appear in a separate HTML browser window if the completion
  is not unique.</p>

  <h3><a href="specialization">Specialization Of</a></h3>

  <p>Use this field to neter the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/ref/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection">collection</a>
  (minus the "#$") that this term specializes, if the term is
  itself a collection. All collections must be at minimum
  specializations of #$Collection. To take advantage of constant
  completion, enter a partial term name and press the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button. Remember that a list of completions
  will appear in a separate HTML browser window if the completion
  is not unique.</p>

  <h3><a name="next-steps" id="next-steps">Next Steps</a></h3>

  <p>If similarity information is provided, the Categorize Term
  leads to the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/help/cb-copy-from-similar.html">Copy from Similar</a>
  page.</p>

  <p>If no similarity information is provided, the Categorize Term
  page leads to the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/help/cb-conceptually-related-terms.html">Conceptually
  Related Terms</a> page.</p>

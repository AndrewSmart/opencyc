  <p>The Cyc OWL Ontology Exporter is a tool for creating an OWL
  file from an OWL ontology specification in a Cyc KB. A Cyc term
  representing the OWL ontology itself is specified for export,
  and each term defined in the OWL ontology is exported to the
  OWL file.  Alternatively, a list of Cyc terms can be specified
  instead on the ontology term.</p>

  <h3><a name="uri" id="uri">Export URI</a></h3>

  <p>Each OWL ontology should have a globally unique, persistent
  uniform resource identifier (URI) by which it can be referenced
  and this is specified with a baseNamespaceForSKS assertion.  If
  this assertion is missing or you just want to specify a
  different URI, you may.</p>

  <h3><a name="terms" id="terms">Exporting owl:sameAs triples</a></h3>

  <p>For each exported term, you can specify one or more
  alternate URIs that will be exported for that term as and
  owl:sameAs triple.  Supported URIs include Readable OpenCyc
  URIs (when applicable), Cyc Compact External ID URIs, and
  DBpedia URIs (when applicable).</p>

  <h3><a name="terms" id="terms">Additional export options</a></h3>
  
  <p>Exporting additional triples for providing #$comment information 
  and "prettyString" lexifications is supported.</p>
  
  <p>When desiring a more precise export, choosing "Restrict
  export to only assertions in the ontology microtheory" will
  only export assertion specified in the precise microtheory of
  the onology (or the overriding mt if specified.)</p>

  <p>Complex OWL restrictions are imported as both a complex term
  and as derived rule macro predicate assertions.  Selecting
  "Suppress export of derived knowledge" will ignore the derived
  knowledge and can result in a more verbatim export of an
  import.</p>

  Reference</a>.</p>

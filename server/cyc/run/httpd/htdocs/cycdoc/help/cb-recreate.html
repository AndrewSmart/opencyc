  <h3><a name="recreate">Recreating a Constant</a></h3>

  <p>Recreating a constant removes from the KB all of the
  assertions involving that constant, while leaving the constant
  itself intact. It is designed for those times when you want to
  get rid of old information on a constant, and start over
  anew.</p>

  <p>Recreating a constant is the recommended way of starting over
  on a constant. Killing the constant and then creating a new one
  by the same name could be problematic, and thus should be
  avoided. Kills should be reserved for when the constant itself
  should be removed from the KB, not just the assertions on it.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to reverse a recreation (short of reasserting
  all of the assertions that involved it before the recreation), so
  it is very important to be sure that killing is what is
  desired.</p>

  <p>To recreate the constant and delete from the KB all assertions
  involving it, press the [<i>Yes, Recreate</i>] button. The number
  of assertions that will be removed are listed just above the
  confirmation buttons.</p>

  <p>To leave the constant and its assertions intact and return to
  the previous frame, press the [<i>No</i>] button.</p>

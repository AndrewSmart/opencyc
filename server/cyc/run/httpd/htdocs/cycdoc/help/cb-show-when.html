  <p>The Display by Date facility allows the user to find and
  display constants or assertions based on the date of their entry
  into the KB. Simply specify the kind of object to display
  (constant or assertion), starting and ending dates, and whether
  to limit the search to any particular cyclist (knowledge-entry
  person).</p>

  <h3><a name="data">Constant vs. Assertion</a></h3>

  <p>To search for constants, click on the button to the left of
  "Constants"; to search for assertions, click on the button for
  "Assertions". It is not possible to search for both at the same
  time.</p>

  <h3><a name="dates">Dates to Search</a></h3>

  <p>You can limit the search by choosing start and ending dates.
  The search will return all constants or assertions created
  between (and including) those dates. Setting the start and ending
  dates to the same date will search over that date only. The
  default value for both start and ending dates is today's
  date.</p>

  <h3><a name="cyclist">Cyclist to Examine</a></h3>

  <p>If you want to search for constants or assertions created by a
  specific user, you can enter that user's CYC&reg; constant (minus
  the "#$") in the input window. The default value is the CYC&reg;
  constant of whatever user is logged into the current CYC&reg;
  image. The search can be further restricted by setting the start
  and ending dates, described above.</p>

  <p>After setting the search parameters, display the assertions by
  pressing the [<i>Submit</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To reset the parameters to their default values, press the
  [<i>Reset</i>] button.</p>

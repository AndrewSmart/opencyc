  <p>The Agenda Status Bar provides information to the user about
  the current state of the CYC&reg; Agenda. This information can be
  updated manually, by clicking on the "Update" link, or it can be
  set to update automatically ("Server Update Interval") via the
  Browser Options page. This link will not appear if "Server Update
  Interval" has been set to an integer value on the Browser Options
  page, and JavaScript is turned off. When frames are not being
  used, this link will update the entire page.</p>

  <h3><a name="mode">Communication Status</a></h3>

  <p>"Comm" lists the current communication status for the CYC&reg;
  Agenda, and is a link to the Communication Status Area, where the
  communications settings can be changed. There are six possible
  combinations of settings, which will show up in the Status
  Bar:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>Sending and Receiving:</i> send processed operations out
    immediately, and receive operations from others.</li>

    <li><i>Sending Only:</i> send processed operations out
    immediately, but do not receive operations from others.</li>

    <li><i>Storing and Receiving:</i> store processed operations
    for later, and receive operations from others.</li>

    <li><i>Storing Only:</i> store processed operations for later,
    but do not receive operations from others.</li>

    <li><i>Not Recording but Receiving:</i> don't make a record of
    processed operations, but receive operations from others.</li>

    <li><i>Not Recording or Receiving:</i> don't make a record of
    processed operations, and do not receive operations from
    others.</li>
  </ul>See the <a href="/cycdoc/help/cb-mode.html">Communication Status Area
  Help</a> page for more details on communications settings.

  <h3><a name="queues">Operations Queues</a></h3>

  <p>When operations on the CYC&reg; KB are set to be processed by
  the CYC&reg; Agenda, they are placed in queues: operations
  originating on other machines go on the remote queue, operations
  originating on the user's local machine are on the local queue.
  These queues will not appear in the Agenda Status bar until there
  are some operations to process.</p>

  <p>"Remote" lists the operations on the remote queue. If only one
  number is listed, all operations from the remote queue have been
  processed locally. If two numbers are listed, the left-hand
  number represents operations that have been read, but have yet to
  be processed. The right-hand number (or the only number in the
  case where there is only one listed) represents the total number
  of operations processed by the current CYC&reg; image, including
  both remote and local operations, regardless of whether they were
  successful or caused an error in the Agenda.</p>

  <p>"Local" lists the operations originating on the local queue.
  If three numbers are listed, the left-hand number represents
  unprocessed operations, the middle represents operations
  processed but not yet recorded, and the right-hand number
  represents operations processed and recorded to the current local
  transcript. Only operations that have been recorded to the local
  transcript will be transmitted when processed operations are sent
  out, either via the Communication Status Area or when "Load
  Transcript File" is selected from the Navigator. If only one
  number is listed all local operations have been processed and
  recorded; however, this number will disappear if these operations
  are sent to the Master Transcript, since doing so will create a
  new Local Transcript. If there are still operations in the local
  queue to be processed, "Local" will appear as an active link to
  the Local Operations page, where the contents of the local queue
  will be displayed, and the user will have the option of clearing
  the entire queue, if desired.</p>

  <p>The System Area and accompanying help page (accessible via the
  "System" link) provide more details about the individual
  queues.</p>

  <h3><a name="agenda">The CYC&reg; Agenda</a></h3>

  <p>The CYC&reg; Agenda is the process which controls the
  functioning of a given CYC&reg; image, including deciding which
  operations to process and how to handle errors during
  knowledge-entry (KE).</p>

  <p>"Agenda" lists the current state of the CYC&reg; Agenda, and
  is a link to the Agenda Process Control, where the current agenda
  operation can be viewed, the Agenda can be turned on and off, and
  the error handling mode can be set.</p>

  <p>The CYC&reg; Agenda can be in one of many states, depending on
  the type of CYC&reg; image being run:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>C images are not multi-threaded, and so have only two
    states:

      <ul>
        <li>None: agenda is not running or has halted (possibly to
        due to an error in the Agenda, or from never having been
        turned on).</li>

        <li>Enabled: agenda has been started and is available for
        operations.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Lisp and NT images are multi-threaded, so there are more
    possibilities:

      <ul>
        <li>None: agenda is not running or has halted (possibly to
        due to an error in the Agenda, or from never having been
        turned on).</li>

        <li>Idle: the agenda is running but has no work to do.</li>

        <li>Run, Running: the agenda is actually in the act of
        executing an operation.</li>

        <li>Everything else: specific states idiosyncratic to
        various Common Lisp implementations. While these states are
        explicitly listed in the Agenda Status Bar, they play no
        significant role in the Agenda Process Control, and so are
        grouped together on that page under "Running", primarily as
        a matter of convenience.<br>
          Some examples:

          <ul>
            <li>Probe</li>

            <li>PMap GetPort</li>

            <li>Selected</li>

            <li>User Input</li>

            <li>Arrested</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <a href="/cycdoc/help/cb-agenda.html">Agenda Process Control Help</a>
  page explains in more detail the two major categories of settings
  for the CYC&reg; Agenda, Halted and Running.</p>

  <h3><a name="image">The CYC&reg; Image</a></h3>

  <p>The CYC&reg; image is the local copy of the CYC&reg; program
  running on a given machine. Different machines will have
  different CYC&reg; images. "KB" identifies the version of the
  Knowledge Base in use.</p>

  <p>"System" lists the current version of the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/ref/glossary.html#SubL">SubL</a> source code for the current
  CYC&reg; image, and is a link to the System Area, where machine
  and image number can be viewed, CYC&reg; patches can be loaded
  (LISP images only), and the CYC&reg; image can be halted (C
  images only).</p>

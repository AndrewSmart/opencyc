  <p>To change the assertion strength of the displayed assertion,
  select a new truth strength (Default or Monotonic), then press
  the [<i>Change Strength</i>] button. The assertion itself is
  displayed in its EL form at the bottom of the page.</p>

  <p>This will delete the assertion from the KB, and reassert it
  with the new strength. This is better than using the Assert
  Similar Formula facility, since it is usually undesirable to have
  the same formula asserted with two different strengths at the
  same time.</p>

  <p>Since changing the truth value of an assertion from TRUE to
  FALSE or vice-versa is effectively reversing the assertion, that
  kind of change is not allowed through this facility. Only the
  truth strength of the assertion can be changed here, not the
  complete truth value. To change the truth value (not strength),
  go back to the Assertion Display Frame, click on "Edit", and
  change the truth value. For help with the Edit Formula tool, see
  the <a href="/cycdoc/help/cb-assert-internal.html">Edit Assertion
  Help</a>.</p>

  <p>To restore the setting for assertion strength to its value
  before editing, press the [<i>Current Value</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To abort the edit completely and return to the previous page,
  press the [<i>Abort Edit</i>] button.</p>

  see <a href="/cycdoc/ref/cycl-syntax.html#assertions">The Syntax of
  CycL</a>.</p>

  <p>This page lists the filename of a selected transcript file as
  well as any operations which have been saved to that file. If no
  operations have yet been saved, a message to that effect will
  appear.</p>

  <p><b>IMPORTANT! A transcript file should never be edited except
  by an experienced Cyclist in an emergency situation. This goes
  double for the master transcript.</b> If a transcript file must
  be edited, be sure that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All parentheses are balanced.</li>

    <li>Any transcript form that is removed is COMLETELY removed.
    This includes the timestamp for that operation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="read">Reading a Transcript File</a></h3>

  <p>Operations in a transcript file are written in the order that
  they were recorded. Thus, newly recorded operations will appear
  at the end of a transcript file.</p>

  <p>Every operation or operation-pair is followed by a timestamp
  operation which records when that operation was processed. Thus
  the assertion of a new formula is actually two operations (the
  assertion plus its timestamp), while an assertion edit is three
  (the deletion, reassertion, and timestamp). The timestamp
  operations are included in the operation counts that appear in
  the Agenda Status Bar under the headings "Remote" and
  "Local".</p>

  <p>Let's say user #$JoeSmith asserts (<a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa">#$isa</a> #$Fred
  HumanAdult) in the #$PeopleDateMt. This would appear in the
  transcript file as:</p>
  <pre>
  (:HP "Guest" 153344) "WILLY-599-19970630100940" 19970630 
    (FI-ASSERT 
    '(
      (:HP "isa" 260) 
        (:HP "Fred" 537024) 
        (:HP "HumanAdult" 13049)) 
    '(:HP "CyclistsMt" 50975076) ':DEFAULT ':FORWARD))

  ((:HP "Guest" 153344) "WILLY-599-19970630100940" 19970630 
    (FI-TIMESTAMP-ASSERTION 
    '(:HP "JoeSmith" 537024) '19970630))
</pre>

  <ul>
    <li>"Guest" refers to the overall owner of the operation. The
    overall owner usually be "Guest" and is nothing to be concerned
    about.</li>

    <li>"WILLY-599-19970630100940" is the CYC&reg; Image on which
    the operation was performed.</li>

    <li>(FI-ASSERT...:FORWARD)) is the assertion itself, including
    Mt, truth value, and direction. Every constant in the assertion
    is followed by its unique constant id.</li>

    <li>The second form is the timestamp information for the first
    operation. "JoeSmith" is the performer of the operation, and
    "19970630" is the date on which the operation was
    performed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="load">Loading a Transcript File</a></h3>

  <p>Operations in the current local transcript can be sent to the
  Master Transcript simply by sending stored operations from the
  Communication Status Area. However, it is sometimes desirable to
  load a transcript manually. Examples of transcripts to be loaded
  manually include: transcripts from a previous CYC&reg; image,,
  transcripts containing operations that were cleared instead of
  being sent to the Master Transcript, or transcripts from other
  CYC&reg; images whose operations have never been sent to the
  Master Transcript, but it's desirable to have them included in
  the current local image. Manually loaded transcripts can be
  loaded up on the local machine and sent (or not) at a later time;
  the user is never committed to sending operations unless the
  communication status is set to "Send Immediately".</p>

  <p>To manually load a transcript file, select the "Navigator"
  link from the Toolbar Frame or the Browser Tools page. Click on
  "Load Transcript File" in the "File Handling" section and follow
  the instructions there.</p>

  Documentation</a>.</p>

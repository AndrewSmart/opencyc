  <h1><a name="SECTION00010000000000000000">Background</a></h1>

  <p>Currently at Cycorp, concepts are labelled in a two phase
  process. First, when the knowledge engineer is creating a
  concept, a phrase is associated with the concept using a
  #$termStrings assertion. This is suitable for retrieving the
  concept using the same phrase, but doesn't allow for recognition
  of simple variants, for example, those based on pluralization.
  Furthermore, these labels are not suitable for generation
  purposes where the form might change based on the context (e.g.,
  'how to swim' vs. 'swimming advice'). Thus, there is a second
  phase in which the plain labels are converted into lexical
  assertions, which encode syntactic information suitable for
  recognizing variants and proper generation. Such assertions are
  generally only made by the NL staff, although KE'ers with
  substantial experience can also make them. Thus there is a
  bottleneck is the process of ensuring that proper
  ``lexifications'' are associated with Cyc concepts.</p>

  <p>As a first step in addressing this problem, the Open Directory
  linking tool introduced a lexical wizard that guided the users in
  the decisions that needed to be made when performing the
  lexification and made the appropriate assertions for them.
  However, this is only applicable for concepts created during
  external concept linking. Also, only a limited range of
  lexifications were supported.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000">Introduction</a></h1>

  <p>The Cycorp Lexification Assistant is extension of the Open
  Directory linking tool lexification wizard that is integrated
  into the browser. The interface is designed to have the feel of a
  Microsoft Windows based wizard. In particular, options can be
  specified one at a time with the next phase invoked via a
  N<small>EXT</small>-&gt;button. Defaults will be filled in based
  on the selection and then the same page brought up for further
  input. When the tool has determined the settings for all options
  needed forthe lexification, a L<small>EXIFY</small> button will
  replace the next button. After the proposed assertion is
  diagnosed OK, the F<small>INISH</small> button will appear,
  signalling that the actual assertion can be made.</p>

  <p>Note that the Lexification Assistant assumes that the user is
  somewhat familar with the underlying predicates. There is a
  separate utility called the <a name="tex2html1" href=
  "/cycdoc/help/sme-lexwiz.html">Dictionary Assistant</a> that asks a series of
  non-technical questions in order to infer the options.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000">General
  Lexification</a></h1>

  <p>For all terms to be lexified, the following options need to be
  specified.</p>

  <table cellpadding="3" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Term</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">The Cyc concept to
      be lexified</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">Phrase</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">A word or phrase
      serving as a label for the term</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">Is preferred?</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">Whether the phrase
      the most suitable form of reference</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">Is proper noun?</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">Whether the phrase
      is a proper name</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">MT</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">Microtheory to use
      for the lexification (usually #$EnglishMt except for
      relations which use #$EnglishParaphraseMt)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000">Proper Name
  Lexification</a></h1>

  <p>Proper name lexification involves selecting a predicate that
  best expresses the relationship of a name to a Cyc constant.
  Often this will just be #$nameString, unless a specialization is
  more appropriate (e.g., #$scientificName). Therefore, there is a
  single option to be selected in this case:</p>

  <table cellpadding="3" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Proper-name-predicate</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">Name of the
      predicate to use (see #$properNameStrings)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00050000000000000000">Denotational
  Lexification</a></h1>

  <p>``Denotational'' lexification involves selecting options
  needed for a #$denotation or one of the multi-word lexification
  predicates (e.g., #$multiWordString). The relevant options
  follow:</p>

  <table cellpadding="3" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Headword position</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">Position in the
      phrase of the headword (i.e., the word that determines the
      grammatic function of the entire phrase)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">Headword part of speech</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">Grammatical part of
      speech of the headword (see #$SpeechPart).</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>A simple rule of thumb for selecting between the #$CountNoun and 
  the #$MassNoun parts of speech is trying to add "some" and see
  if it now would sound best as a plural. If plural is what works
  best, it is a count noun (i.e. you can count them).</p>

  <p>For example, you would say "some pens" (note the plural), but
  "some butter" or "some malnutrition" (no plural). Therefore, "pen" 
  is a count noun, while "butter" and "malnutrition" are mass nouns.
  </p>

  <p>Whenever the selected headword for a phrase being lexified
  doesn't have an entry in the Cyc Lexicon, the ``No suitable parts
  of speech'' error message will be displayed and the
  A<small>DD</small> M<small>APPING</small> button will be shown to
  allow the syntactic information to be added via Wales. For
  documentation using Wales for this purpose, see <a name=
  "tex2html3" href="/cycdoc/help/lexwiz-wales.html">lexwiz-wales.html</a>.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00060000000000000000">Relation
  Lexification</a></h1>

  <p>During lexification of relation terms, the term itself is not
  lexified, since relations are only of interest when instantiated.
  Instead, relational lexification involves creating a #$genFormat
  statement which indicates how a particular instance of a relation
  along with the arguments can be paraphrased into English. The
  relevant options follow:</p>

  <table cellpadding="3" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Relation template</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">Template for
      relational lexifications (via #$genFormat)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">Argument specification</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">Argument
      specification for the relational template</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">Skip arity checks?</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top" width="360">Whether to bypass
      the relation arity checks</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>An introduction to the use of #$genFormat can be found in
  <a name="tex2html4" href="/cycdoc/ref/generation.html"</a>.</p>

  <p>Keywords commonly used in the argument specifications:</p>

  <table cellpadding="3" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td align="left">:quote</td>

      <td align="left">Use concept name rather than NL
      paraphrase</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">:plural-generic</td>

      <td align="left">Use a plural noun form</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">:singular-generic</td>

      <td align="left">Use a singular noun form</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">:mass-number-generic</td>

      <td align="left">Use a mass (aka non-count) noun form such as
      'sand'</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">:non-plural-generic</td>

      <td align="left">Use either a mass or a singular form</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">:non-singular-generic</td>

      <td align="left">Use either a mass or a plural form</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">:a</td>

      <td align="left">Include the determiner 'a' or 'an' as
      appropriate</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">:the</td>

      <td align="left">Include the determiner 'the'</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left">:gerund</td>

      <td align="left">Use a progressive verb form such as
      'walking'</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The following points should be kept in mind:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <em>phrase</em> option is currently ignored</li>

    <li>Only select <em>Skip arity checks?</em> when really
    confident.

      <p>This option is a temporary workaround until more
      sophisticated checks are implemented for ensuring that the
      template corresponds to the argument specifications.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Do not add determiners (e.g., 'a') in the relation
    template.

      <p>Determiner words should not be placed in the relation
      template. For example,</p>
      <pre>
    (genFormat genls 'a ~a is a ~a' (1 2))
</pre>Instead, the determiner keywords should be used, such as :a
or :the.
      <pre>
    (genFormat genls '~a is ~a' ((1 :a :singular-generic) (2 :a :singular-generic)))
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Adornments are the little icons that appear next to (before)
  an assertion or constant in the browser. You can see your list of
  active adornments at the top of the index pane when viewing a
  constant. You used the link there to get to the page that brought
  you here.</p>

  <p>Each adornment has an effective-function associated with it.
  This is the code that tells the adornment if it should appear for
  a particular assertion or constant when the adornment is
  active.</p>

  <p>For each adornment the table presents it's name, the symbol
  that will appear when the effective function says that the term
  should be so adorned, if the adornment is (currently) active, if
  it is dynamic (which means that the adornment will display
  information about the term when the mouse is over the adornment),
  if it has a link (which means that selecting the adornment will
  take you to another page), it's type (described below), a comment
  about the effective function of the adornment, and a link to the
  tool the link will generally take you to itself.</p>

  <p>The types indicate what sort of terms the adornment operates
  on. The currently supported types include:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>:assertion</dt>

    <dd>the adornment is for terms that represent assertions</dd>

    <dt>:constant</dt>

    <dd>the adornment is for terms that represent constants</dd>

    <dt>:arg-predicate</dt>

    <dd>the adornment is for terms that represent an index</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Other types, such as :arg-predicatex are :arg-predicate
  adornments that are only to be displayed when specifically
  requested by the browser, instead of for all occurances of the
  type. Generally this is used to prevent all the terms from
  redundantly matching, and instead only showing an adornment when
  the term occurs at a particular position on the page. For
  instance, :index-constant is for constants that occur in the
  index position of the display page.</p>

  <p>To modify the set of adornments that are displayed with each
  assertion or constant, individual adornments may be activated or
  deactivated with the appropriate button on each line of the chart
  on this page. For those adornments that are strongly related to a
  particular tool (generally, that tool is invoked when the
  adornment is selected), the tool is also presented in the chart
  on this page.</p>

  <p>To restore the adornments to the state they held when entering
  this page, press the [ <i>Current Values</i>] button.</p>

  <p>To abort the edit completely and return to the previous page,
  press the [<i>Back</i>] button.</p>

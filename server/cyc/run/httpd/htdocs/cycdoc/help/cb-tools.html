  <p>This page allows the user to customize the toolbar (the top
  frame of the browser window), by adding or removing links to the
  tools listed on this page. It also serves as a launching point to
  the rest of the tools in the KB Browser.</p>

  <h3><a name="update">Changing the Toolbar</a></h3>

  <p>To add tools to the Toolbar, select the check box to the left
  of the tool to be added. To remove a tool, uncheck the relevant
  box. Then, making sure the buttons by the tools you want
  displayed in the Toolbar are checked, and the tools you don't
  need are unchecked, click on the button labeled [<i>Update
  Toolbar</i>] to initiate the changes. Note that it is not
  possible to remove "Tools" from the Toolbar Frame.</p>

  <p>The [<i>Current Values</i>] button resets the buttons to their
  values before any changes were made.</p>

  <p>To abort out of updating the Toolbar, press the
  [<i>Cancel</i>] button, which will return you to the previous
  frame.</p>

  <h3><a name="navigate">Navigating Around the KB Browser</a></h3>

  <p>Each of the tools listed on this page is a direct link to that
  tool. Thus this page can also be used as a "stepping stone" to go
  to those tools which you don't use often enough to merit its
  being added to the toolbar. To use a tool, simply click on its
  highlighted name. Note that not all tools will be available in
  all versions of the CYC&reg; System, particulary the Wales and
  WordNet tools at the end of the list.</p>

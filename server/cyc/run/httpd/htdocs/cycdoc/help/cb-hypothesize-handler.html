  <h3><a name="hypothesize">Hypothesized Formulas</a></h3>

  <p>When doing knowledge-entry, it is sometimes desireable to
  hypothesize a formula to the KB. This is sort of like saying,
  "What if proposition P were true?"</p>

  <p>When a formula is hypothesized to CYC&reg; in a particular
  <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>,
  CYC&reg; creates constants for any variables, and treats the
  resulting assertion(s) as true. For example, if the following
  formula were hypothesized in the #$BiologyMt:</p>
  <pre>
    (<a href="/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and">#$and</a>
      (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa">#$isa</a> ?DOG <a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a>)
      (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa">#$isa</a> ?CAT #$Cat)
      (#$enemies ?DOG ?CAT))
</pre>two things would happen:

  <ol>
    <li>New constants would be dynamically created for the
    variables, in this case ?DOG and ?CAT. These variables would
    have names along the lines of:
      <pre>
    #$HYP-DOG-42375192581
    #$HYP-CAT-8479329834
</pre>The "HYP" shows that the constant was created through
hypothesizing (as opposed to being created by a user, or through
skolemizing). The number at the end is used to uniquely identify
the new constant. Remember that an <a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Individual">#$Individual</a>
dog and an individual cat are being hypothesized here, not a
<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection">#$Collection</a>,
and CYC&reg; may hypothesize many over time. So the number is
needed to set each new instance apart from prior ones.
    </li>

    <li>The assertions involving these new constants would be
    asserted to the KB in the microtheory chosen for the
    hypothesizing. For the example above, the following assertions
    would appear in the #$BiologyMt:
      <pre>
    (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa">#$isa</a> #$HYP-DOG-42375192581 <a href="/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog">#$Dog</a>)
    (<a href=
"/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa">#$isa</a> #$HYP-CAT-8479329834 #$Cat)
    (#$enemies #$HYP-DOG-42375192581 #$HYP-CAT-8479329834))
</pre>In other words, the two new individual animals created are
enemies of each other. Note that we have NOT said that all cats and
dogs are enemies, only that these two particular ones are.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="entering">Entering a Formula</a></h3>

  <p>Enter the formula to be hypothesized in the "Formula" input
  window, as in the example above. Note that conjunctions and
  atomic formulas make the best hypothesized formulas. Use the
  [<i>Complete</i>] button on any partial constant being entered in
  the window.</p>

  <p>In the "Mt" input window, enter the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a>
  (Mt) where the results of the hypothesizing should go (minus the
  "#$"), using the [<i>Complete</i>] button if necessary. The
  default Mt is the <a href=
  "/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB">#$BaseKB</a>.</p>

  <p>Press the [<i>Hypothesize</i>] button to hypothesize the
  formula in the desired microtheory.</p>

  <p>The [<i>Reset Values</i>] button will return both input
  windows to their initial settings.</p>

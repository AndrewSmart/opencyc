  <p>The Local Operations page displays the (unprocessed) contents
  of the local queue, and allows the user to clear the contents of
  the queue, if desired. This page will only be accessible when
  there are operations in the local queue that have not been
  processed yet.</p>

  <h3><a name="contents">Viewing the Local Queue</a></h3>

  <p>The Local Operations page displays two things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The number of (still unprocessed) operations currently in
    the local queue.</li>

    <li>The operations themselves, in order. The first operation in
    the queue will be the next one processed, the last one in the
    queue will be the last one processed, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="clear">Clearing the Local Queue</a></h3>

  <p>Sometimes it is desirable to clear the entire contents of the
  local queue. The most common situation where this might be
  desired is when:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A local operation causes the Agenda to halt (i.e., causes
    an error). You can tell this by going to the Agenda Process
    Control, accessible via the "Agenda" link in the Agenda Status
    Bar.</li>

    <li>The operations in the rest of the queue depend upon the
    first operation being processed, and may cause errors
    themselves if allowed to go through without the first one
    working.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To clear all of the operations in the local queue, press the
  [<i>Clear Local Queue</i>] button. A confirmation page is
  provided in case the user decides not to delete the entire queue
  after all.</p>

  <p>Note that this will clear every operation in the queue. If
  there are some that you wish to save for entry later, you may
  want to copy them to a temporary file. To abort out of any
  error-causing operation (instead of clearing the entire queue),
  go to the Agenda Process Control and start the Agenda up again.
  The operation that caused the error will be aborted. (This only
  works if the Agenda is in "Halt and Display Reason" mode. If the
  error handling mode is set to "Enter the Debugger", the operation
  must be dealt with in the window where the CYC&reg; process was
  started up--most likely an emacs window.)</p>
